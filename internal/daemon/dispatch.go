// nonReentrant lists actions the daemon refuses to run concurrently per window.
// A DRC re-check piles a second full-canvas recompute onto the webview while
// the first is still grinding (worst on a background window, where it NEVER
// finishes — docs/reviews/2026-07-esp32mini-findings.md A4); retries therefore make the hang worse,
// not better. The guard turns that into an immediate, explainable rejection.
//
// ── Does the connector's FIFO queue make this redundant? NO — keep it. ─────
//
// Connector 1.0.3 runs every action through one FIFO queue per window
// (extension/src/action-queue.ts), so two DRCs can no longer overlap on the
// webview. That removes the *overlap*, not the reason this guard exists:
//
//   - **Queuing and refusing are different answers.** A FIFO can only DELAY;
//     it has no way to decline. A second DRC would sit behind a 60s+ recompute
//     and then run a second full-canvas recompute on a webview that just
//     finished one — the caller waits minutes to learn what this guard says
//     immediately ("one is already running; if it never settles, foreground
//     the window"). The whole point is to stop the ask, not to sequence it.
//   - **Only the daemon can see the second asker.** The guard is what makes a
//     retry loop — or a second client/agent driving the same board — fail
//     loudly instead of silently stacking work.
//   - **A queued long action would burn its whole budget waiting.** With the
//     connector abandoning a head past its own timeoutMs, a DRC that queued
//     behind another DRC could be abandoned before it ever started, which is
//     both wasteful and reports as an ambiguous failure.
//
// And the converse: the daemon deliberately adds NO general per-window
// ordering beyond this. Serialization belongs at the connector, the only place
// that can serialize the *handlers* — a daemon-side queue would order the
// dispatches while the handlers still raced, i.e. cost without the guarantee.
