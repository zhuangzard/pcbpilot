// Daemon-level concurrent-writer advisory (issue #108).
//
// Multiple clients (foreground CLI, background agents, raw HTTP callers) can
// drive the SAME window through one daemon with no mutex whatsoever — observed
// live on the 2026-07-15 esp32Mini regression, where a stopped background
// agent kept replaying a stale routing plan against the board a foreground
// session was fixing. This guard makes the collision visible: the daemon
// tracks the last successful mutating client per window and ANNOTATES (never
// blocks) a different client's mutating action with a top-level
// `concurrentWriter` field the CLI surfaces on stderr.
//
// State machine (per windowId, in-memory — same lifetime rationale as
// staleGuard: windowIds churn on reconnect and a fresh window starts clean):
//   RECORD — a mutating action (catalog Mutates=true, same source of truth as
//            autosave) with a non-empty ClientID succeeds → it becomes the
//            window's last writer.
//   WARN   — a mutating action arrives from a DIFFERENT non-empty ClientID
//            while the last writer is younger than concurrentWriterWindow.
//   EXPIRE — last writers older than concurrentWriterWindow never warn (the
//            sessions are no longer plausibly concurrent) and are dropped.
//
// Client identity vs session identity: ClientID is "<hostname>:<pid>[:<label>]"
// and the pid makes it precise for AUDIT attribution — but every one-shot CLI
// invocation is a fresh pid, so comparing full ClientIDs would flag an agent's
// own consecutive commands as "another client" (observed on the first live
// smoke: same label, new pid, spurious warning on every mutating step). The
// guard therefore compares SESSION identity (see sessionKey): hostname+label
// when a label is present, hostname alone when not. Consequences, deliberate:
//   - two sessions with different PCBPILOT_CLIENT_LABEL values warn — this is
//     the issue-#108 mechanism (label your background agents);
//   - one labeled session warns against an unlabeled one (keys differ);
//   - two UNLABELED processes on the same host never warn: one-shot processes
//     give the daemon nothing to tell "same agent, next command" apart from
//     "second agent" — the audit log (with pids) remains the forensic tool,
//     and same-host multi-agent detection requires labels.
//
// Non-goals (deliberate): reads never warn (they cannot conflict), the same
// session writing repeatedly never warns, empty ClientIDs are neither recorded
// nor warned about (nothing to attribute), and nothing is ever blocked — a
// hard per-window lease stays future work until a real need shows up.

// concurrentWriterWindow bounds how long a past writer counts as "concurrent".
// Beyond this the earlier session has almost certainly finished; warning would
// be noise.
