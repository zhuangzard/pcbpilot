# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- Live-verified on desktop V3 3.2.149 with connector 0.3.1 (2026-09-25): `pcb region create`
  reads back the region (`verified:true`) and refuses a name on a non-follow-rule region with
  nothing created; `pcb add-component` returns the read-back designator (`bindingVerified:true`);
  `pcb modify` works and `pcb modify` / `pcb delete` with a stale ID return `PRECONDITION_REFUSED`
  with no write dispatched; unknown subcommands exit 1; `project find --timeout` returns `unknown`
  on an empty inventory. Net label on V3: the normal path (host returns the object) passed; the
  empty-return readback recovery was not triggered. `web reload` is Web-only and not yet live-tested.

Ports from upstream easyeda-agent v1.6.0..v1.7.0 (behavior ported, adapted to pcbpilot names/ports;
not yet live-verified on pcbpilot's connector). Requires a connector rebuild/re-import.

- Typed Web editor page reload: new connector action `system.page_reload` (scheduled from the
  host global realm through a fixed, payload-free AsyncFunction because EasyEDA shadows `window`
  and `Function` in handler scope) and CLI `pcbpilot web reload` (saves the exact active document,
  freezes a component-ID baseline, requires a NEW connector registration in the same project,
  at most one typed `document.open` restore, stable fresh readback; reports `saveMs`,
  `reconnectMs`, `elapsedMs`). Explicit, user-requested only — not a recovery path for a hung
  editor. Upstream f05f25c, 439137f, fe68d8b, dbaf316.
- Write verification (upstream dbaf316, c476f6d): native net-label writes are recovered from a
  unique fresh Name attribute + parent-wire readback when the host returns no object; uncertain
  outcomes return `partial:true, verified:false` with no automatic retry or stub rollback
  (a settled, provably empty no-write keeps pcbpilot's live-verified V3 wire-name path in
  `connect_pin`). `pcb.region.create` verifies layer/rules/geometry/name/lineWidth/lock from a
  fresh inventory and refuses a name outside follow-rule (9) regions (the `pcb antenna-keepout`
  path no longer sends a name). `pcb.add_component` returns the re-read designator/uniqueId with
  `bindingVerified` (partial when unproven). `pcb.component.modify` / `pcb.component.delete`
  refuse stale IDs against the live inventory with `PRECONDITION_REFUSED` before any write.
  CLI: an ok:true response with `partial` or `verified:false` from these four actions exits
  non-zero (raw JSON unchanged); `sch autoconnect` treats it as a non-retryable failure.
- CLI: an unknown subcommand under a command group (`pcbpilot sch not-a-command`,
  `pcbpilot pcb config typo`) now fails with exit 1 and "unknown command" instead of printing
  help with exit 0; a bare group still prints help. Upstream bf355d7.
- CLI: `pcbpilot project find --timeout <d>` bounds the whole lookup scan (default 90s, 5s–10m;
  one detail read per project UUID made a 52-project team exceed the old ~20s budget). A timeout
  is still `unknown`, never absence. Upstream c6bdc05.
- CLI: known-bug advisories on stderr (Chinese, linking upstream issues #256/#257/#258 observed
  on Web 4.1.60) before `sch modify`, `sch no-connect --clear` and non-dry-run `pcb config` rule
  writes. Raw stdout JSON and exit codes are unchanged; reads, help, `--dry-run` and NC set stay
  silent. Upstream 1414784 (its extra non-zero exit for `sch` `verified:false` not ported).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-25

Requires re-importing the connector (0.3.0) together with the matching CLI/daemon.

- **Daemon login service is required**: `pcbpilot daemon service install|status|uninstall`
  (macOS launchd, Linux systemd --user, Windows HKCU Run). `setup-agent.sh`, `install.sh`
  and `install.ps1` install it and the post-install verify fails without it (`--no-service`
  removed). `launchctl bootstrap` retries launchd's asynchronous bootout.
- Fresh-agent E2E (esp32MiniRequire §1, desktop V3) findings, all fixed and live-verified:
  footprint NPTH/slot regions (USB-C locating holes) are modelled from `pcb.footprint.sources`
  and checked by `pcb check` (`footprint-hole-clearance`); `pcb auto run` retries high-speed
  nets with skew/plane-split/via findings on finer grids (ESP32 mini 78 → 92); a route-only run
  with `--mech` writes only mechanics the board lacks; MicroFix moves vias and shifts along
  the true normal; mounting-hole blocking keeps the full clearance; plane fan-out failures
  retry nearby sites and the headline reports signal and plane connections separately;
  `pcb silk-align` converges on read-back bboxes (the connector no longer scores a label
  collision as clean) and `pcb check` adds `silk-overlap`; ESD parts no longer get a plug
  envelope and named differential pairs are exempt from the 3W rule; `sch gate` by project
  name finds the UUID-keyed module groups; multi-page compose saves before the gate and defers
  unmatched cross-page ports; `sch sheet-geometry` reports the inner border (Blade Width,
  pixel-verified 10 raw on A4); `audit cost` uses local time by default.
- `pcbpilot sch groups`: schematic module frames → PCB placement groups for any schematic
  (new read-only `schematic.rectangles.list`). `pcb auto run --refine --only <refs>` adjusts
  named parts on a confirmed layout; placement-only plans keep the live stackup. Experimental
  two-stage macro placement is opt-in (`--macro`; lost the 8-board A/B on 7).
- `project.export` archives larger than 1 MiB no longer fail ("unexpected end of JSON input").
- Standard parts: `led.red_0805` (C2296 KT-0805Y) is yellow — corrected, red alternative noted.

- New read-only `pcb.footprint.sources` (per-instance footprint source of the
  active PCB, epro2 fallback keeps every FOOTPRINT row) and
  `pcb.components.list` now carries each part's `footprint` instance ref, so
  `pcb dump` can model footprint NPTH/slot FILLs (USB-C locating holes) that
  native DRC checks as "Slot Region".
- **EasyEDA Pro V3 and V4 both supported** (host profile by version: line,
  native net labels, pin-level attributes, unset-style reads). Verified on the
  desktop V3 3.2.149 and pro.easyeda.com. V3 net labels are written as the
  wire's own Name attribute (`wire.modify` + anchor), never delete-and-recreate
  (that deleted a merged +5V tree). Unset V3 style fields read as `null`.
  New read-only `system.api.probe` / `pcbpilot api probe`.
- Component `modify` re-asserts a real LCSC `supplierId` (V3 resets it to
  `<MPN>.1`, which broke identity evidence). Export-image clears the selection
  first and refuses stray selected primitives.
- Schematic layout: zones from design intent (`sch zones-derive`), zones →
  composition (`sch layout-composition`), same-sheet convention (net labels
  inside a page, ports across pages: `net_label` / `direct_label` policies),
  edge label planning for dense symbol edges, conflict fingerprints and budget
  escalation, measured designator poses per rotation.
- PCB (`pcb auto run`): autoSize frame search with a quality gate; schematic
  module ownership via `--groups`; automatic RF-module antenna keep-out split
  so the module does not trip native DRC; block-declared connector openings on
  board edges; replayable mechanics (`--replace <journal>`); switch nodes stay
  out of power planes; truthful module bodies (antenna ends). `pcb dump`
  normalizes rotations; `pcb check` no longer flags buck output caps.
  Live-verified on the ESP32-S3 mini E2E layout (desktop V3).
- Connector 0.2.8: `pcb.silk.list` reports attribute `keyVisible` / `valueVisible`
  (hidden Footprint/Device texts are no longer silkscreen findings);
  `pcb.silk.align` turns a designator upright before measuring it (14 of 30
  landed on pads when planned with the sideways extents); `pcb clear --only
  copper` keeps MULTI-layer mounting-hole fills (they belong to `regions`).
- PCB routing (`pkg/pcbauto`): board hole-to-hole rule (`pcb dump`
  `rules.holeToHoleMil`, JLC 0.254 mm fallback) between all vias; adjacent
  same-net pins share a fan-out via; vias inside pads only on IC/module thermal
  pads; delivered copper is checked at 0.01 mil and sub-0.25 mil shortfalls are
  micro-fixed (shift, then narrow) instead of ripped; the placer prices a
  twisted differential pair; duplicate segments are dropped. Pad-to-pad daisy
  growth for differential nets exists but is off (fixture regression). The
  hole-to-hole rule is enforced only when the board declares it (a live
  `pcb dump`); an assumed default cost the K230 fixture 300 fan-out vias.
  Capacitors from an IC signal pin to ground/rail (reset RC, debounce) are
  "pin-filter" members held at that pin (the ESP32 EN cap sat 10 mm away).
  Placement is deterministic per seed: anneal cooling follows the move count
  (the clock only guards the last 20 % of the budget) and auxiliary ownership
  no longer depends on Go map order.
- `scripts/setup-agent.sh` + `scripts/agent_clients.py`: one-shot install from a
  clone for Claude Code, Codex/Codex Desktop, ZCode and `~/.agents`; retires an
  upstream easyeda-agent install (MCP removed, skills moved to a restorable
  backup); daemon as a launchd / systemd --user login service; ends with a
  verification (per-client registration, no upstream left, skill links, a real
  MCP initialize + tools/list handshake). `pcb check`: OVAL pads as stadiums,
  poured nets' single-layer vias, via-in-pad by real copper. `pcb pour-fit
  --replace` is layer-scoped. `pcb dump` adds `contentSha256` (stable across
  pour re-materialisation). ESP32 E2E routed live: native DRC clean.

- New read-only `schematic.components.count` / `pcb.components.count` (primitive
  ids only): the CLI's post-switch load-settle loop polls these instead of the
  full ~1.5 s `components.list` (57 % of schematic machine time in real runs).
  Older connectors fall back automatically.
- Ported from upstream easyeda-agent `dev` (unreleased, cherry-picked and renamed):
  schematic designator geometry and sheet-symbol source export, native project
  source export, native attribute visibility recovery for unreadable fields,
  sparse-attribute rereads, typed project-creation reconciliation, and the
  CH340C block's USB ESD fix (SM712 → USBLC6-2SC6).

- Ported from upstream easyeda-agent v1.6.0 (cherry-picked, adapted to
  pcbpilot names): typed `project.open` / `project.export` handlers
  (`project-transfer.ts`) for cross-project open with identity checks and
  native `.epro2` export; `schematic.drc.check` now returns the host's own
  strict-mode verdict (`nativePassed`) and reports unknown counts as `null`
  instead of fabricated zeroes. The CLI/daemon side (V3 `net_label` refusal,
  local-edit finding deltas, `daemon stop/restart`) needs no connector change.
  Requires re-importing the connector together with the matching CLI/daemon.

- Header menu renamed from "EDA Agent" to "PCB Pilot" (id and title). The host
  de-duplicates header menus by id, so sharing upstream's "EDA Agent" id made
  the two connectors' menus collide when both are installed. The About dialog
  now names the PCB Pilot Connector. Requires re-importing the connector.
- Package hygiene: `.DS_Store` is excluded from the `.eext`, and the logo SVG
  source moved to `docs/brand/pcbpilot-logo.svg` so the package carries only
  `images/logo.jpg` (EasyEDA imports rejected packages silently while it was
  present; the cause was not isolated).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-23

Placement engine release: `pcb auto` now places parts the way an experienced
layout engineer does — cores first, then each auxiliary at the pin it serves —
and models the physics that decide a board's EMI and robustness.

- Core/auxiliary understanding: every passive gets an owner core, a role
  (hot-loop, bootstrap, decap, clock, power-stage, feedback, protection, pull,
  signal, chain, test) and a target pin, reported in `report.md` 「布局依据」.
- Switching converters: buck/boost recognition with confidence (rectifier
  diode = certain; PMIC, input-named rail, buck prior = likely), per-channel
  input rail, hot-loop capacitor (buck input / boost output), bootstrap and
  feedback divider; placement minimises the hot-loop polygon and keeps
  feedback off the inductor and switch node.
- Interface signal chains: connector/antenna/RF connector → ESD → series
  parts → IC in schematic order; ESD first and on the trace, diff-pair parts
  side by side, antenna feeds priced by full length and marked RF; port
  reserve strips keep other blocks off protected connector edges.
- Decaps graded by value; the smallest cap on each power pin is treated as
  its high-frequency decoupler. ESD arrays designated `U`, chip antennas and
  coax RF connectors are classified correctly.
- Deterministic polish of critical parts after annealing; cooling tracks wall
  time; `Part.Body` rigid-bounds cache (large BGA boards place in ~17 s).
- `pcbpilot pcb auto bench`: human vs engine placement on the same yardsticks
  (layout-score, wirelength, decap distance, hot-loop perimeter, chain order),
  with `--dump-dir` and `--moves`. On the six real fixture boards the engine
  placement now scores above the human one (offline, no routing compared).
- New PCB Pilot connector logo. The connector runtime is otherwise unchanged
  from 0.1.0; re-import only to pick up the new version/logo.

Status: offline-verified. Not yet live-verified in EasyEDA; routed comparison
of engine placements and the R-0 fan-out DRC gate defect remain open.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-22

First pcbpilot release. pcbpilot is a fork of
[zhoushoujianwork/easyeda-agent](https://github.com/zhoushoujianwork/easyeda-agent) (MIT);
thanks to the original author and contributors, whose history is preserved.

- Rebrand to pcbpilot with its own identity so it installs beside upstream
  easyeda-agent: CLI `pcbpilot`, skills `pcbpilot*`, `~/.pcbpilot`, `PCBPILOT_*`
  environment variables, daemon/connector ports 61832–61841, connector
  "PCB Pilot Connector" with a new uuid, release channel `zhuangzard/pcbpilot`.
  Self-update and skill sync never fall back to upstream.
- New `pcbpilot pcb auto analyze|run`: offline electrical-aware engine
  (`pkg/pcbauto`) — circuit understanding (blocks, links, voltage domains,
  isolation barriers), IPC-based widths/clearances, 2/4/6-layer stackup and
  split planes, mechanically constrained placement with HV/LV zones,
  plane-first negotiated-congestion routing, length tuning, exact DRC and SI
  checks; emits an `apply` playbook, preview SVG and Chinese report.
  Status: offline-verified. Known defect R-0: under routing timeout the final
  DRC gate does not remove violating fan-out vias (seen on BGA boards).
- Skill: precise-instruction recipes (schematic→PCB handoff, power.json,
  mech.json, HV/LV isolation, high-speed, pcb auto run/review/apply), the
  collaboration workflow (PCB check-only by default), and
  `scripts/pad-net-diff.py` pad-by-pad schematic↔PCB net reconciliation.
- `HV_*` / `+HV` net names are no longer treated as mains.
- The connector runtime is unchanged apart from its identity and port range;
  it must be imported as a new extension (it does not replace upstream's).

The entries below were accumulated on the development line before the fork.

- Add daemon-side `pcb via-fence` for perimeter-only GND/RF stitching around a protected rectangle. It includes each corner once, redistributes every edge so `--pitch` is a maximum spacing, expands outward with `--margin`, uses live via rules for unspecified sizes, and keeps dry-run pure. The AT32F415 crystal example now treats its former TOP/0-via route as verified historical evidence rather than a final design: the replacement `crystal-guard` contract jointly requires controlled MCU spacing, shorter/direct OSC paths, a real TOP GND guard, TOP/BOTTOM `no-pours` regions, and a GND via fence outside the protected envelope.
- Bootstrap the Connector when EasyEDA evaluates its entry bundle without dispatching `activate()`. Keep one versioned transport controller on the host's shared per-extension `eda` object so repeated bundle evaluations delegate `start`, `stop`, `reconnect`, and status reads instead of registering duplicate sockets. `deactivate()` stops and releases that controller for a subsequent reload. Verified on macOS EasyEDA 3.2.203 with an official 1.5.2 cold-start baseline that did not connect, followed by import-time and fresh-process bootstrap registrations where `activateObserved=false`; this does not establish the behavior of Windows 3.2.149 or a startup path that never evaluates the bundle.
- Gate on netlist availability, not just pin geometry. `pinsAvailable` proves the PIN API read succeeded; it says nothing about whether the netlist that every pin's `net` comes from was fetched. A muted export leaves every pin's `net` null while `pinsAvailable` stays true, so a downstream reader could not tell "this pin has no net" from "no net could be read". `sch block-apply`'s layout proof and `sch designators plan` now require `netlistAvailable` and report the netlist as the cause when it is missing.
- Surface the same distinction in `sch layout-lint`: parts whose geometry is proven but whose pin-to-net attribution is not are reported as a separate `nets-unproven` category (new `netsUnproven` field, its own strict-gate reason and summary column) instead of being conflated with the legacy-connector `unprovenPins` bucket, which would send the reader to a different fix.
- Skill: `sch read.floatingPins` may only be recorded as `connectionState:"unconnected"` when `sch read.netlistAvailable` is true — with a muted netlist every pin lands in that list, so it states a failed read rather than an unconnected design.

## [1.5.3-dev.6] — 2026-09-22 (local development)

- Add fail-closed typed `document.close` and use it for `doc reload`, removing the old `debug.exec_js` close path. The close request binds both the fresh document UUID and tab ID, preserves the official split ID when readable, and only then allows typed reopen plus fresh document/object settlement checks.
- Normalize `pcb.poured.list` materialized copper from the SDK's native 0.1mil units to mil, including nested contours and arc commands, while preserving `fill:false` thermal-spoke paths as stroked geometry instead of misreporting them as invalid polygons.
- Allow `doc ls` and UUID-based `doc open` to recover a project with no active document tab while keeping every other `document.current` failure closed.

## [1.5.3-dev.5] — 2026-09-22 (local development; fresh UUID fallback)

- Repackage the dev.4 crystal-guard connector under a fresh extension UUID after the Web host reported the new manifest version while continuing to dispatch the cached pre-`pcb.poured.list` bundle. The runtime handler probe, rather than the version string, remains the acceptance gate; remove the stale connector after importing this fallback to avoid competing sockets.

## [1.5.3-dev.4] — 2026-09-22 (local development)

- Add typed `pcb.poured.list` and `pcb dump --include-copper` evidence for routed copper, regions, static fills, pour boundaries, and materialized poured geometry while distinguishing a known-empty board from unavailable geometry.
- Add schema-v2 `crystal-guard` planning and `pcb module-check`: assemble and rigidly transform the crystal/capacitor module offline, recompute fixed-MCU routes, emit whole-board/local/comparison previews and a typed Apply playbook, then verify the journal, preserved non-owned objects, dual-layer no-pours, GND guard/via paths, and materialized copper after reload.
- Harden `pcb via-fence` obstacle and parameter checks and report routed `pcb net-path` length and turn count for candidate comparison.

## [1.5.3-dev.3] — 2026-09-20 (local development)

- Move the supported EasyEDA product mainline to V4 (recommended V4.1.60+), expose a separate host compatibility report in `easyeda health`, and update the Connector type baseline to `@jlceda/pro-api-types` 0.4.25 without confusing the V4 product version with the official 3.2 extension API engine.
- Preserve V4 schematic pin `otherProperty` in component snapshots, reject plural symbol/device/footprint variant shapes before mutation, and support explicit custom-designator validation/preservation without guessing the editor's increment policy.
- Add `install.ps1` for native Windows (Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7), usable as `irm .../install.ps1 | iex`. It mirrors `install.sh`: the same `EASYEDA_VERSION` / `EASYEDA_INSTALL_DIR` / `EASYEDA_INSTALL_SKILLS` / `EASYEDA_SKILL_PRESERVE` / `CODEX_HOME` / `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / GitHub-token / mirror knobs, `checksums.txt` fetched from GitHub before any mirror fallback is allowed, SHA-256 plus CLI `--version` plus Skill `metadata.version` verified before an installed file is touched, and the same stage-then-swap Skill replace with backup/restore and `.version` marker. Windows-specific: a running `easyeda.exe` is renamed aside so a locked upgrade still completes, and the user PATH is changed only on explicit request while the machine PATH is never touched. `install.sh` now points Windows users at it, and releases publish `install.ps1` next to `install.sh` with a checksum.
- Make `pcb stackup set` read back copper count and every requested inner-layer type. Rejected layer writes now return unverified/partial evidence and a non-zero CLI status instead of a false success; repeated matching requests are no-op verified.
- Accept only relative IEEE roundoff in PCB rule write/readback and idempotence; keep exact source-drift checks and reject missing fields, unit changes and real value differences. Found on Web 3.2.203 during live clearance write.
- Add typed `pcb.net.color.set` and `pcb config net-color` with hex RGB input, preserved alpha, dry-run and strict readback failure reporting.
- Require expected versions and SHA-256 hashes for the development connector hot reload; replace the index and bundle atomically while preserving existing permissions.
- Live Web 3.2.203 validation on the 69-component exam PCB covers dry-run, rule/via/class/color writes, strict readback, save/reload persistence, idempotent replay and full baseline restoration. The fixed ESP32 regression persisted 31 components, four copper layers, inner GND/+3V3 pours and its antenna keep-out, but remains incomplete: native DRC has 53 unique violations and requested inner `PLANE` types revert to `SIGNAL` after reload. The temporary Board was deleted after preserving evidence.
- Add `pcb snapshot --fit-mode board|all|none`; Layout review now defaults to the public `zoomToBoardOutline` plus viewport capture, records the actual fit API and `objectLevelExport:false`, and keeps the editor's internal object-level Copy-as-PNG/SVG capability explicitly unsupported until it has a public `eda.*` wrapper.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-09-20

- Add typed `pcb.config.get/set` and `pcb config get/clearance/track/via/bind` for parameterized PCB design rules: mil/mm conversion, Track-to-Track clearance, named track rules, via diameter bounds, and class/member Track assignments. Preserve unrelated settings, preview exact changes, detect source drift, and report unverified writes as partial failures. Reuse full-rule rollback/readback and accept config exports for restore. Real Web 3.2.203 fixtures cover the 260919 exam settings offline; live save/reload and the fixed ESP32 end-to-end regression remain pending.

- Accept English “Confirm Importing changes information” / “Apply Changes” during typed PCB import, normalize whitespace/case, and retain exact button matching (#223). CLI diagnostics stop on unconfirmed import instead of directing an Agent to edit the project manually.
- Document the V3.2 extension Config/Enabled permission controls and reported cross-version installation/cold-start workarounds (#222). The 3.2.149 cold-start defect (#221) remains unresolved; module bootstrap proposal #219 is not included.
- Centralize long-read budgets at the CLI HTTP boundary: document open receives a 30s daemon window and includePins reads receive 150s, plus the existing 2s HTTP response grace. Explicit shorter diagnostic deadlines and larger caller budgets remain intact (#207, #214). Verify the live target UUID after an open error before failing the document guard.
- Stop zone-arrange repair immediately on a failed connect_pin write, removing both unconditional replay and later repair-round replay (#206). This does not cancel late host promises or resolve the separate late-write cleanup issue #208.
- Refocus the Skill on parameterized, source-attributed examples and typed-only project operations; include the existing main-branch workflow and PCB configuration work in this release.
- Validation boundary: automated Go/connector/lint/Skill/release checks are run for this patch. No EDA window is connected on the release host, so the fixed ESP32 end-to-end regression and fresh-connector live import/save/reload verification remain incomplete. Do not treat this release as a completed board acceptance.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-09-17

- Add offline `sch zone-review` ownership diagnostics and run them automatically before `layout-plan --zones`. Reports preserve source hashes and explicit component/pin/net evidence for multi-core hints, non-rail subgraphs detached from the declared core, and rail-only attachment endpoints, while leaving the source JSON and Apply state untouched for AI review.
- Keep source rotation authorization intact when a reviewed component becomes the zone core. The effective solver permission is narrowed to the measured core angle, preserving the fixed anchor without requiring the AI to rewrite component evidence.
- Add `lib device validate --spec` as an offline preflight for datasheet-backed library authoring. Complete Device builds now require manufacturer/MPN/package evidence with source pages, a declared land-pattern basis, valid symbol/footprint geometry, and an exact pin-to-pad mapping before any EasyEDA mutation. Route the public Skill through the new PDF-reading workflow and provide a reusable JSON example.
- Preserve the live Safe Spacing matrix's object-pair dimension in `pcb check`: Track↔Track now uses its own rule instead of the larger Track↔Pad/Via routing clearance (#218).
- Decode the verified board-outline `ARC,signedAngle,endX,endY` source format with direction-checked ≤2° sampling, and select a unique containing outer ring from multi-polyline outlines while keeping unknown curves and ambiguous rings fail-closed (#215).
- Refuse repeated Symbol/Footprint library builds before mutation when the opened asset already contains supported primitives or its inventory cannot be proven empty, preventing invisible duplicate pads and pins without relying on destructive replace semantics (#204).

## [1.5.0-dev.14] — 2026-09-17 (local development only; fresh-session live validation required)

- Treat schematic wire geometry as a visible 1-raw stroke consistently in cluster and final marker validation. Reject foreign wire contact with marker body/text; exempt only the exact generated lead of that marker at its own anchor, by marker identity and exact two-point geometry.
- Expand deterministic island naming order retries without weakening geometry. Align checkpoint rollback with the already shared candidate allowance, and prioritize the fresh measured pose with a bounded 3/4 allocation (150,000 maximum) while preserving budget for explicitly allowed rotations.
- Replay the unchanged retained P1 and P2 sources successfully under their original per-zone 200,000-candidate limits, including a legal DTR/C7-GND separation. These are offline source results; dev.14 is not installed or Web-applied, and this is not v1.5.0 release acceptance.

## [1.5.0-dev.13] — 2026-09-17 (local development only; fresh-session live validation required)

- Share one page-scoped explicit ownership predicate between schematic layout-lint and cluster validation. Tight spacing inside the same declared module/zone or persistent functional group is allowed, while positive-area overlap, cross-owner tight spacing, missing ownership and conflicting geometry remain blocking.
- Preserve each owned wire's complete polyline envelope for cluster occupancy and sheet bounds, but judge member collisions against the official independent flat segments. Empty corners of an L-shaped wire no longer manufacture an overlap; a real segment or marker crossing another component still fails.
- dev.12 applied P1 through step 185/188 with complete electrical, bridge and official DRC checks, then stopped at the strict layout gate on four same-function tight pairs plus one L-envelope false overlap. Final explicit save and final instance reconciliation did not run; dev.13 requires a fresh-session gate and must not resume the old queue.

## [1.5.0-dev.12] — 2026-09-17 (local development only; fresh-session live validation required)

- Split compose's project-wide duplicate-designator preflight from its target-page instance-preservation guard. The cross-page step now requests only the complete tagged component inventory and checks refs, primitive IDs and planned absences; it no longer repeats slow device-identity, bbox or pin hydration.
- Keep the following target-page guard unchanged and exhaustive for device identity, native instance state, geometry, pins, nets, NC, wires and connectivity summary. Add positive and negative regressions for the minimal guard, cross-page duplicates and unrelated slow-field exclusion.
- dev.11 completed the P2 read-only validation, but both fresh P1 Apply attempts stopped at step 1 before mutation when the unnecessarily heavy cross-page read triggered Connector re-registration. dev.12 must be installed and validated from a new session; neither dev.11 queue may be resumed.

## [1.5.0-dev.11] — 2026-09-17 (local development only; live revalidation pending)

- Accept a proper interior X as verified non-contact when a host returns blank raw wire nets but each physical island still has complete, unique, mutually consistent official pin-netlist and marker evidence. Keep X islands separate and continue to reject missing/conflicting evidence plus endpoint, T and overlap contacts.
- Preserve the official observed `flat-segments` encoding in the Go live survey so Designator collision checks evaluate each four-coordinate segment independently instead of inventing a tail-to-head diagonal between records.
- Add positive and negative regressions for blank raw wire nets, missing/conflicting island evidence, phantom flat-segment connectors and real Designator crossings. dev.10 completed its P2 writes but stopped at the strict gate; dev.11 requires a fresh-session live revalidation and must not resume the old queue.

## [1.5.0-dev.10] — 2026-09-17 (local development only; live revalidation pending)

- Preserve strict `--preserve-instances` source-wire equality across playbook JSON save/reload. Normalize the generated source scene to JSON-native arrays so an unchanged wire list is accepted while added, removed, or changed wires still fail closed.
- Add serialized-playbook regressions for wired and wire-free pages, including a negative unexpected-wire case. The dev.9 live queue stopped before its first design mutation; dev.10 must be installed and validated from a fresh snapshot rather than resuming that queue.

## [1.5.0-dev.9] — 2026-09-17 (local development only; Web Apply pending)

- Add `sch layout-edit` for stable-ID core moves and D1.3-style pin-marker repair. Core moves translate one owned zone exactly once, preserve all other zones, and fix the requested core coordinate while replanning only its peripherals when a rigid move collides.
- Persist explicit pin and wire-tree marker anchors. Reject reversed pin exits, ambiguous physical wire islands, cross-zone shared branches, stale source/page/live geometry and exhausted bounded searches instead of guessing ownership or silently retargeting a pin label to a trunk.
- Add the daemon-local `schematic.pin.repair_marker` action for a serialized, journaled replacement of one verified wire+marker branch while unrelated legacy findings and out-of-scope objects remain byte-stable. Partial writes, timeouts, stale fingerprints and altered marker orientation fail closed without retry or rollback claims.
- Cover rigid/replanned moves, multi-level attachment non-duplication, fixed-page compose, D1.3 `(165,1050)→(145,1050)`, old-error-preserving scoped repair and failure paths. Retained original P1/P2 inputs replay offline successfully; this is not a Web Apply or v1.5.0 release acceptance claim.

## [1.5.0-dev.8] — 2026-09-16 (local development only; live acceptance pending)

- Synchronize the Skill and algorithm-validation documentation with the packaged obstacle-aware solver and its exact local-runtime boundary. Preserve the dev.7 algorithm and regression results unchanged; Web Apply still requires a fresh-session local version gate.

## [1.5.0-dev.7] — 2026-09-16 (local development only; live acceptance pending)

- Add bounded obstacle-aware 5-raw directional A* routing after straight and orthogonal fast paths, with official pin-exit direction, 40/80/160/320-raw search envelopes, exact physical-island merge verification, and shared contact semantics for X crossings, T contacts, endpoints and overlaps.
- Route pins and existing wire trees directly to another same-net physical island, including legal mid-segment tree access; preserve a crossing as one uninterrupted segment so exporting a route cannot manufacture a junction.
- Add bounded whole-round wire rerouting and evidence-driven rigid relocation of blocking components plus explicit attachment descendants. Preserve explicit attachment and allowed-rotation authority, share node/candidate budgets, and retain deterministic termination classes.
- Persist replayable success/failure reports with source hashes, route timing, expanded-node and reroute counts, failed islands, candidate summaries and attributed rejected edges; diagnostic output remains ineligible for compose or Apply.
- Pass the retained original P1 three-zone and P2 five-zone offline regressions without mutating their inputs. P1 uses 184,652/200,000 expanded nodes and four reroutes; live Web Apply and readback remain separately gated.

## [1.5.0-dev.6] — 2026-09-15 (in development; not installed or accepted)

- Add an instance-preserving composition path for existing schematic relayouts, with source and readback guards for native identity and original properties. Source implementation and offline tests are present; live validation remains pending and dev.5 remains installed.
- Isolated EasyEDA Pro 3.2.186 probes confirm that proper interior crossings remain disconnected, while endpoint T contacts merge nets. Align planned and observed physical-contact topology with these distinct semantics; retain hard pin/body/text and foreign-contact checks. This is not a live page-repair acceptance claim.
- Expose offline layout diagnostics through `sch layout-plan --report`, preserving the source hash and structured failure chain while retaining nonzero failures and no partial layout output. General solver validation, rather than a single repaired schematic, is the development objective.
- Attribute placement conflicts to attachment hosts and both sides of geometric obstructions, including prior wire owners. Backjump over unrelated checkpoints only with complete ownership and no possible future host; retain the original bounded search budget. Cover successful repairs, conservative refusal and identity/rigid-transform invariants with synthetic regressions.
- Refuse unsafe legacy group-move/disconnect operations before mutation for unsupported multi-segment or crossing topology and missing geometry; retain simple single-segment behavior.

## [1.5.0-dev.5] — 2026-09-14 (local development only; acceptance pending)

- Preserve measured world-coordinate pin directions through layout parsing, rigid rotations and candidate validation. Share first-segment direction and narrowly scoped own-pin stroke-halo checks with the mandatory execution guard.
- Route out of both physical pins before turning; reject side-entry routes during offline planning instead of relying only on the later live execution refusal.
- Reserve a minimum 5-raw outward escape for each connected pin while placing components, so a peripheral cannot block a still-unwired core pin. Do not create imaginary electrical wires for this geometric reservation.
- Search a bounded set of explicitly permitted peripheral poses when the source pose cannot yield a complete baseline. Preserve a 20,000-candidate source window, share the total budget across attempts and report every failure without claiming global infeasibility.
- Keep complete measured pin-direction evidence in variant preservation checks; reject candidates that drop or forge the supplied direction.
- Live dev.4 negative validation detected 14 P1 and 11 P2 violations and proved automatic refusal without mutation. This development work does not yet establish repaired ceshi pages or release acceptance.

## [1.5.0-dev.4] — 2026-09-14 (local development only)

- Preserve explicit fail-fast end-to-end probe deadlines while reserving bounded before/after geometry-read budgets for normal schematic mutations. Keep the connector's original write execution deadline unchanged.
- Include the completed dedicated-signal ownership guard and actual-wire readback regressions from the development validation cycle; live acceptance remains separately required.

## [1.5.0-dev.3] — 2026-09-14 (local development only)

- Share pure pin-exit and wire/body checks between schematic check and mandatory daemon mutation guards; reject invalid typed wire requests before dispatch and verify live wire coverage afterward, without an optional strict flag.
- Serialize writes and document-changing reads during automatic verification; preserve the original action deadline plus separate geometry-read budgets and expose partial/unknown outcomes as failures.
- Preserve explicit core/peripheral ownership in complete compose/Apply validation; require real peripheral attachment paths and local core/peripheral signal trees, not matching labels or frames.
- Expose geometry-only pin reads without compiling a netlist, stable wire IDs and explicit wire-read availability; retain null net evidence rather than inventing floating connections.
- Add regression negatives for the actual USBC1 reverse fanout and label-separated peripherals. Offline checks do not constitute installed or live schematic acceptance.

## [1.5.0-dev.2] — 2026-09-14 (local development only)

- Add data-driven live schematic checks for overlapping module frames, free-text geometry, and visible Designator geometry/containment; missing required geometry is an error instead of a silent pass.
- Exclude Value, model, MPN, description, and other non-Designator component properties from page collision, clearance, frame containment, and fallback reservation calculations while preserving their source data.
- Fix the schematic architecture baseline around immutable observations, explicit core/peripheral ownership, complete zone solving, rigid whole-zone page placement, fixed conversion, official readback, strict gates, and explicit save; mark superseded workflows across project and Skill documentation.
- Add sanitized ceshi geometry regressions and positive/negative tests for Designator collisions, Value exclusion, live frame overlaps, and incomplete visual evidence.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-09-17

### Added

- Expose reusable, library-independent schematic layout calculation and deterministic SVG rendering through `sch layout-plan` and `sch layout-render`.
- Add isolated zone repair, consistent sheet/zone padding, stable Z-order packing, bounded same-page alternatives, and orientation candidates for compact layouts. Compile approved page placements without silently repacking them.
- Add data-driven schematic zone ownership review, explicit core/peripheral attachments, source-preserving `sch layout-edit`, and protected local marker repair with fresh-snapshot and out-of-scope stability guards.
- Add bounded obstacle-aware directional A* routing on the 5-raw grid, physical-island-to-tree joins, legal non-contact X crossings, whole-round rerouting, evidence-driven component relocation, and replayable routing diagnostics with shared budgets.
- Add strict live schematic gates for zone frames, Designator geometry, marker collisions, pin-exit direction, wire/body contact, physical bridges/orphans, instance identity, and source/readback connectivity equality. Non-Designator properties remain excluded from layout collision and frame bounds.
- Add a sanitized public reusable-module catalog with explicit `draft`, `topology_ready`, and `compose_ready` readiness checks. Source exercises, reference drawings, private instance identities and local drafts are not release assets.
- Support verified offline development packages through `update --local-dir`, exact development-runtime checks, and Makefile targets for installed local daemon restart and validation.

### Fixed

- Bound and reuse request-local device identity reads in the Connector, preserving strict provenance checks and a dedicated CLI response budget.
- Preserve direct-net constraints during dense-pin naming retries; compact marker leads and module frames; normalize floating-point arithmetic tails without hiding meaningful geometry changes.
- Preserve same-side repeated signal `module_port` pins as one real in-zone fanout tree after a functional split while retaining the source cross-zone port contract. Keep interleaved nets electrically separate and verify the exact physical islands that were joined.
- Treat measured Designator bboxes as closed routing/placement obstacles, avoid caching transient maze-budget failures across later legal branches, and tolerate only sub-micro-unit floating-point drift around the documented 1-raw marker graze threshold.
- Preserve native instance IDs, device identities, properties, wires, pin nets and NC state through fixed-page Compose/Apply. Split fast project-wide designator preflight from the exhaustive target-page preservation guard without weakening either result.
- Use the correct net-port action kind when materializing schematic data.
- Preserve the intended eight-second place execution window plus response grace, retain structured dispatch errors, and advise readback before retrying placement on either HTTP or daemon deadline failures (#213).
- Use the shared 35-second connect-pin request budget in schematic layout and recovery callers (#205).
- Observe actual, bounded bypass reads before diagnosing a blocked connector queue; missing, failed or stale evidence stops automatic queue waiting (#209).
- Classify debug script compilation failures as non-mutating request refusals; preserve execution failures, including runtime SyntaxError, as possible partial writes (#211).

### Upgrade and validation scope

- This release includes Connector runtime changes. Upgrade CLI/daemon and Skill together, and install a **1.5.x Connector**; a 1.4.x Connector is outside the new compatibility line. The Connector UUID remains unchanged.
- The automated release checks cover Go, Connector, Skill data and packaging, plus native installation smoke tests. They do not replace live electrical-design or complete requirement-to-four-layer-PCB acceptance; the full board regression was not rerun for this release.
- Live EasyEDA Pro 3.2.186 validation completed the P1 six-zone Type-C/ESD split with the default routing budgets, protected Web Apply, strict gate, unchanged connectivity/instance properties, explicit save, and official SVG/PNG export. P2 read-only regression passed earlier in the development cycle; this remains schematic scope rather than full-board release acceptance.

## [1.4.9-dev.1] — 2026-09-12 (local development only)

- Add offline local package installation and content-verified runtime checks; no tag or upload.
- Require exact development versions across CLI, daemon, Skill and all connectors.
- Include bounded, request-local cached device identity reads and decoupled compact schematic layout/rendering fixes.
- Local automated validation does not constitute live EDA or full board acceptance.

## [1.4.8] — 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Keep the strict latest-release session gate for CLI, installed Skill and running daemon, while accepting Connector patch drift within the same major.minor compatibility line. Patch-only upgrades no longer ask users to update the plugin marketplace Connector or relaunch EasyEDA; cross-minor/major Connector drift still blocks with the sideload and full-relaunch recovery steps.
- Retry GitHub release assets up to three times, then use a configurable `gh-proxy.com` transport fallback only when `checksums.txt` was obtained directly from GitHub. Mirror-delivered CLI and Skill archives remain subject to the GitHub-published SHA-256 digest; `EASYEDA_GITHUB_PROXY=off` disables fallback.

### Validation

- Go update/runtime/daemon version-gate tests and installer regressions pass, including same-minor Connector compatibility, cross-minor refusal, primary-download failure, mirror fallback and checksum enforcement.

## [1.4.7] — 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Authenticate latest-release checks with `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and fall back from an exhausted GitHub API quota to the public `releases/latest` redirect. Apply the same redirect fallback in the one-line installer so an HTTP 403 does not falsely block an otherwise current installation.

## [1.4.6] — 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Make `easyeda update --check --exit-code` an exact GitHub-latest Agent-session gate for the CLI, installed Skill, running daemon and every connected Connector. Ahead, development, unknown, disconnected and stale states now block; Skill upgrades require ending the loaded Agent session and starting a new one before EDA work resumes.
- Include Codex Desktop's active shared Skill root (`~/.agents/skills/pcbpilot`) in installer detection, version reports and atomic Skill updates.

## [1.4.5] — 2026-09-09

### Documentation

- Document the current Altium Designer project-import boundary: use EasyEDA Pro's GUI for `.SchDoc` / `.PcbDoc`, treat the beta API's `undefined`/no-op result as failure, and verify imported schematic, PCB outline and mechanical-layer data before continuing (#203).
- Define release numbering and retention: patch for releases without connector-runtime changes, minor when users need a connector update, one maintained patch per minor line, and immutable published tags/releases retained for rollback and verification.

## [1.4.4] — 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Keep the DSH bundle version aligned with this release and publish to SkillHub using its environment token without writing a runner credential file.
- Verify explicit resistance queries numerically before ranking parts; preserve milli/mega prefixes and reject matches inferred from MPN digits. Add Skill guidance to retain parameter sources and verify manufacturer-specific value codes (#202).
- Skip rotation calibration when connecting a native schematic net label, which has no rotation parameter. The host's EDA v4 label API remains pending on the tested 3.2.186 host; this does not claim native-label compatibility is fixed (#191).
- Resolve DSH MCP and Skill file URLs with Node's `fileURLToPath`, preserving Windows drive/UNC paths and escaped characters (#201); add cross-platform path and native-launch CI tests.

- Pass the officially resolved split-screen ID when opening documents, avoiding PCB reopen hangs observed after closing a tab on EasyEDA 3.2.186; do not report ready when the active document is still different.

- Keep PCB document and board metadata readable after mutations so `doc reload` can recover stale primitive reads; metadata reads do not clear the stale-read gate.

- Fix PCB silk text creation: use registered `default` font and legal LEFT_TOP alignment in free text, net names and pad labels; empty font / alignment 0 was rejected by EasyEDA 3.2.186.

- Let an exact `--doc` UUID use matching live document/result context without depending on the PCB name catalogue. Reject inconsistent project, document or type evidence.

- Recover an active PCB missing from document enumeration using official current-PCB information, requiring matching project/document identity before accepting the name (#190).
- Accept action request bodies up to 32 MiB for base64 3D model imports (#199); test the exact limit and one-byte overflow.

- Add `sch modify --patch-file` and `pcb modify --patch-file` for PowerShell 5.1 JSON quoting failures (#192). Accept UTF-8 BOM files, reject conflicting inline/file sources and non-object JSON before dispatch, and preserve explicit schematic flag overrides and PCB center guards.
- Document native net-label API compatibility limits and readback requirements (#191).

### Validation

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 native executable regressions pass for both schematic and PCB patch files; Linux/macOS/Windows install smoke and DSH path tests pass in CI.
- 20 resistance-selection regressions, 60 script tests, 280 connector tests and the Go/Skill checks pass. Live EasyEDA 3.2.186 PCB moves, silk creation and save/reopen readback pass.
- Native net-label creation (#191), grouping (#173) and the complete ESP32 board acceptance (#43) remain open. Issue #200 was already closed with a suggestion to use the web editor; its original old-host failure was not independently reproduced. Actual 3D import and the complete Windows DSH loader/editor workflow were not rerun.

## [1.4.3] — 2026-09-08

### Added

- Calculate reusable schematic Lib circuits from canonical nets and measured pin geometry, then compose compact Z-order pages with independently sized frames, minimum inner clearance, pink dashed borders, and 0.2-inch titles.
- Add full schematic design comparison and guarded incremental frame/title Apply. Preserve explicit unconnected pins and compile reviewed NC-to-connected additions without changing valid original designators.
- Document the three-part same-version contract for CLI/daemon, Skill, and Connector, with copyable AI-agent prompts that require local canonical data, diff/Apply, readback, gates, save, and visual export review.

### Fixed

- Resolve placed component identity from native library provenance and reconcile readback evidence without false design differences. Single-page snapshots may infer an omitted page ID; conflicting or unknown cross-page evidence remains rejected.
- Normalize numeric comparison and hashing without hiding real geometry changes. Treat drawing fields absent from readback as incomplete/unverified instead of claiming exact synchronization.
- Validate CLI and Skill downloads before installation, honor explicit binary/client directories, preserve shared Skill symlinks, and remove retired Skill files during normal updates. Preserve mode retains the previous version marker.
- Return failure when an update fails, validate exact binary/Skill versions and checksum entries, and keep daemon startup Skill sync aligned with the running release. Reject unknown clients and relative client directories.

### Validation and limits

- Add reusable release-asset and isolated CLI smoke checks, Bash installer failure regression tests, and native Ubuntu/macOS/Windows CI checks including real download, execution and replacement of a temporary binary. Only macOS execution has been verified locally; this does not constitute a complete EDA acceptance run.
- The access control example's live Apply/readback preserved 23 components and 165 physical pins while adding 12 reviewed connections and clearing four incorrect NC states. Local layout/check/bridge gates report zero errors and warnings; official DRC remains at 3 WARN, so strict acceptance is not claimed.
- HostLink, PTT, RF LED and the conflicting TALK GPIO4 responsibility remain unresolved. The full `esp32MiniRequire.md` requirement-to-four-layer-PCB regression was not rerun for this maintenance release.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-09-06

### Added

- Introduce the 1.4 schematic connectivity IR: stable component IDs, separate display references and functional roles, complete pin/net/NC records, and reusable Lib membership.
- Compile measured symbol geometry and local Lib circuits through `sch compose` into guarded, sequential `sch apply` queues. Support compact Z rows, fixed margins, pink dashed frames with 0.2-inch titles, and collision-checked straight terminal leads with staggered lengths.
- Add `sch designators allocate/plan/verify`: preserve valid references, allocate invalid functional names from official library prefixes, and verify instance identity, geometry and wiring before and after an in-place repair.
- Add local-only `make release-check` and `make release-build`, version/asset verification, and a tracked-file Skill packager shared by release channels.

### Fixed

- Match schematic footprint names case-insensitively, prefer available footprint identity, and isolate resolution caches by that identity (#197).
- Count only enabled PCB copper layers, honor an explicit stackup specification, and prevent routing or power-plane operations from silently changing a board's layer count (#198). Missing layer evidence stops the operation; preview and execution use the same stackup preflight.
- Load every existing page before the global designator guard, including pages not yet visited in the current editor session. Reject incomplete all-page inventories or a failed return to the original page.
- Improve stale connector/window cleanup, reconnect session handling and connection diagnostics; document that updating an extension does not replace the runtime already loaded by an open editor.
- Make Skill references and helpers work outside a repository checkout, consolidate the current data-to-Apply workflow, remove obsolete layout instructions and repeated historical notes, and correct Bash installer examples.

### Validation and limits

- The two-page access control example's conversion and separate designator repair were verified against live readback; the final designator repair preserved all 23 components, 165 pins, 84 connections and 81 NC states. Official DRC still reports 15 existing network warnings; this is not a completed electrical-design or PCB acceptance test.
- Composition consumes supplied circuit data and geometry. It does not invent peripheral circuits, automatically split/create pages, rotate/scale symbols, or generate standalone Notes. Existing strict gates remain in force.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-09-01

- Add typed `library.model3d.search` and `library.model3d.copy` actions for selecting existing library models without UI automation.
- Add `library.device.set_model3d` with exact Device-name preflight, model existence checks, bind/replace/clear support, and association readback verification.
- Expose the workflow through `easyeda lib model3d search/copy` and `easyeda lib device model3d`.

## [1.2.14] — 2026-09-01

- Add `circles[]` to typed symbol authoring for pin-1 and polarity markers.
- Correct the SD-card example to use inward-facing pin labels and a pin-1 ring.
- Add one-shot CLI `lib device build --spec`: create and bind Symbol + Footprint + optional 3D, with reverse-order rollback on failure.

## [1.2.13] — 2026-09-01

- Add typed symbol geometry authoring (`library.symbol.build`) with validation and readback.
- Add typed 3D model import/read/delete backed by the official `lib_3DModel` API.
- Allow CLI Device creation to bind Symbol + Footprint + 3D Model.

All notable changes to the **EDA Agent Connector** (the easyeda-agent project's connector extension) are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions
follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.12] — 2026-09-01

### Added — 可复用库命名与无损封装复制

- 新建 Symbol、Footprint、Device 统一使用跨项目 `EA_AGENT__<ASSET>` 命名。
- Device 搜索支持指定 `libraryUuid`，可精确限定个人库。
- 新增 `library.footprint.copy` / `lib footprint copy`，通过官方库 API 无损复制
  复杂封装并立即回读验证；适合含弧线、区域、文字和机械细节的卡座类封装。
- 新增 Symbol、Footprint、Device 的名称防误删 typed delete，并适配库删除后的缓存行为。

## [1.2.11] — 2026-08-31

### Added — 单器件库封装创作

- 新增个人库、工程库与系统库标识查询。
- 新增封装、符号和 Device 的创建与读取命令，Device 可显式绑定符号、封装和
  3D 模型引用。
- 新增 JSON 驱动的封装构建：一次创建焊盘与图形线，保存后逐图元回读验证；
  中途失败会返回结构化 partial/rollback 结果，防止盲目重试。
- 新建封装、符号和 Device 自动使用跨项目可复用的 `EA_AGENT__<资产>` 命名，和
  用户原有库资产隔离；项目来源放扩展属性而不是名字。新增三类资产的安全删除。
- 封装丝印使用编辑器实际支持的 Polygon + Polyline 图元路径；已在 EasyEDA Pro
  3.2.186 中以 R0603（2 焊盘、4 条丝印）热加载验收通过。

## [1.2.10] — 2026-08-27

### Fixed — README 演示图改回包内相对路径(1.2.9 换版本号重传未解决,定位到真因)

1.2.9 曾假设「市场服务端处理 README 偶发失败,纯换版本号重传即可」——**这个
诊断错了**。1.2.9 重传后逐字节 diff 市场存的 readme 字段与本地文件,发现除
三张图片行被整行删除外**其余文字一字不差**,不是粗暴的解析失败,是精确命中
这三行。扫了市场上 100+ 其它插件的 README(同款 `image.lceda.cn` 图床、同款
排版),`image.lceda.cn` 绝对链接普遍工作正常,排除了「服务端偶发抽风」。

真因转向:README 里硬编码的三个 `image.lceda.cn` URL 不是本次上传产生的
——是半年前 0.23.0 那次转存时铸造的老链接,此后一直复用到 1.2.9。怀疑市场
对图片 URL 做了版本归属绑定,渲染当前版本时把「挂在旧版本记录下」的图片
引用当滤除对象。改回包内相对路径 `images/demo-*.png|gif`,让市场重新执行
「README 抽图 → 转存图床 → 改写链接」流程,为当前版本铸造全新 URL。

> 抽图又失败,再退回绝对链接但换成全新图床 URL(而非复用旧链接)。

## [1.2.9] — 2026-08-27

### Fixed — README 重新提交(诊断有误,见 1.2.10 订正)

无代码/行为变更,纯 bump 版本号重传。原以为是市场服务端处理 `.eext` 时
偶发失败——**订正见 1.2.10**:实际是精确摘除三张图片行,不是偶发解析
失败。

## [1.2.8] — 2026-08-27

### Fixed — 旋转探测旗删不掉就漏在画布上,拖垮 `sch gate --strict`

`detectRotationNegation()` 为测平台的旋转语义(createNetFlag 在某些 build 上**存储
取负**)会在离画布极远处造一支一次性探测旗 `__ROTPROBE__`,读回 rotation 再删掉。

那句 `delete` **没有回读验证** —— 而「删除撒谎」是本仓在别处早已按批处理 + 回读
兜住的平台已知病(delete 返回真值而图元仍在);delete 抛错还会被 `catch` 吞掉。
一旦撒谎,探测旗就永久留在画布上。

代价不在电路,在**判据**:`sch bridge-check` 把它算成一条 orphan-flag,于是
`sch gate --strict`(S5 逐页门用的就是它)在一块电路完全正确的板子上 FAIL
(2026-08-26 esp32MiniRequire 端到端实测,POWER 页)。

现在 delete → 回读 → 重试(至多 3 轮),仍在就经 `eda.sys_Log` 明着记一条并附上
清理命令 —— 沙箱里 `console` 是死代码,sys_Log 是唯一诊断出口。

> daemon 侧另有一层收口(`sch_tool_probe_residue.go`):按网名把探测残留归类成
> 「工具自己的垃圾」,不计进板子的 orphan 账但照常报出 + 给清理命令。那一层对
> **已经装好的**旧连接器立即生效;这一层才是治本。

## [1.2.7] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed — 图签**其实一直能写**:是回读太早把成功报成了失败(#186)

承接 1.2.6。修完损毁问题后实测「文本项写不进去」,一度以为是平台限制 —— **错了**。

真机复验:把 `Name` 写成 `"TB-BOOL-TEST"` 的调用回执报
`nothing was applied: Name`(硬失败),**三秒后再读,值好端端在那儿**;单写
`Drawed` 同样如此。也就是说**平台提交明细表是异步的,写完立刻回读拿到的是旧值**,
handler 把一次成功的写判成了彻底失败。

这条误报的代价远超它自己:它让「图签写不进去」变成流程里的既定结论 ——
design-flow 因此禁用图签写入、`sch gate --strict` 的 `missing-titleblock`
被认定为结构性不可达。**实际上那条路是通的。**

修法:回读改成轮询到落定(命中即返回,常见路径零额外延迟;最多 4 次 × 250ms 退避)。
仍对不上才判 `notApplied` —— 那时它是真的没生效,不能拿等待去粉饰。

两个新单测钉正反两面:慢落定的写不再被误报(且**只写一次** —— 重试的是读不是写);
始终不生效的项轮询完仍如实报失败。

## [1.2.6] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed — 明细表写入不再损毁图框(#186,社区报告 + 真机复现)

`schematic.titleblock.modify` 把调用方给的 `titleBlockData` **原样**下发给平台。
于是最自然的用法——`titleblock.get` 拿完整数据 → 只改一个文本项 → 整包传回——
会把 `Device`/`Symbol` 的 value(`"Drawing-Symbol_A4"`,那是**符号的名字**)一起写下去,
平台把它灌进了 sheet 的 **component/device/symbol UUID 引用位**:

```
修改前  component.uuid = 2cdbe1a3210dccf2   device.uuid = 2cdbe1a3210dccf2   symbol.uuid = bffa68140727fa20
修改后  component.uuid = Drawing-Symbol_A4  device.uuid = Drawing-Symbol_A4  symbol.uuid = Drawing-Symbol_A4
        Border 1→0    Title Block 1→0
```

EasyEDA 当场报「发现异常数据,以下元件的 器件/符号 属性有误」,保存后**重启即拒载 = 图框丢失**。
而动作本身还返回 `ok:false`(「nothing was applied: Name」)—— **报失败、画布却已被写坏**,
是最坏的一种组合。这与「库占位 Designator 被灌进 otherProperty」是同一类事故:
**读回来的投影字段不许原样写回去**。

修法:下发前按结构键过滤。

- **黑名单而非白名单**:明细项的键名**由图框模板决定**(默认 A4 是 `Name`/`Drawed`,
  另一些模板是 `Title`/`Designer`),白名单会把自定义图框的合法字段全拒掉;
  而结构键是图框**数据模型**的固有部分,与模板无关,可以稳定枚举 ——
  图框身份(`Device`/`Symbol`/`ID`)、纸张几何(`Size`/`Page Size`/`Width`/`Height`/
  `Blade Width`/`Region Start`/`X·Y Region Count`/`Title Block Position`)、
  开关(`Border`/`Title Block`/`Color`),外加 `@` 前缀的平台投影项。
- **原样带回来的结构键静默丢弃**(值与画布一致 = 调用方并不想改它),回执给 `ignoredKeys`;
- **真想改结构键则零变异拒绝**(`PRECONDITION_REFUSED`),报文点名字段并给出正路
  (换图框走 `prim-delete --allow-sheet` + `place`)。审计日志里那次「拿明细表当纸张属性写」
  (`Size`/`Width`)的真实失败,现在**在下发之前**就被拦住,而不是写下去再报「没生效」。

两个新单测钉住:结构键拒绝时**一次平台调用都不许发出**;报告人的整包回传用法
下发 payload 里**一个结构键都没有**、只有那个真正要改的文本项。

## [1.2.5] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed — 「用户参数写错」不再把连接器染成 DEGRADED

新增错误码 **`PRECONDITION_REFUSED`**:handler 在**动手之前**拒绝、**画布一个字节都没改**
的那类失败。daemon 的写健康度(`writehealth.go`)**完全不采样**这个码。

起因是 1.2.4 的差分对命令加了三处前置校验(网名不在板上 / 同名约束内容不同 / 正负网填成
同一条)。真机连打几次错网名之后,`daemon health` 就把连接器判成 **DEGRADED** 并点名
`pcb.differential_pair.create` 是「最差路」—— 而连接器与平台全程健康。根因:健康度的
`failed()` 判据是「`ok:false` 且未证实落地 → 算失败」,它分不清**「这条路不通」**和
**「你给的参数不对」**。

误报的代价不是难看,是**把真信号淹掉**:同一个 `failureRate` 里既有「socket 死了、
register 被静默忽略」(issue #185 那类真停摆),也有「网名打错了」。

**豁免必须窄**,只收三个码:`PRECONDITION_REFUSED` / `MISSING_PAYLOAD_FIELD` /
`UNKNOWN_ACTION`。**`INVALID_STATE` 故意不在其列** —— 它既可能是「你要的事讲不通」,
也可能是「编辑器状态真的坏了」,一刀切会把真故障一起吞掉;要豁免的 handler 应显式改用
新码,而不是放宽白名单。使用新码的前提是**零变异**:已经写了东西就不许再用它
(该走 partial / 结构化成功,#151)。

差分对与等长组的 8 处前置拒绝已全部迁移到新码。四个 Go 单测钉住:拒绝零采样、
真故障码(含 `INVALID_STATE`、空码)照常计入、拒绝穿插在真失败之间不稀释失败率。

## [1.2.4] — 2026-08-26

### Added — 差分对 / 等长网络组终于能建了(#176)

`pcb report` 一直能**测**差分对 skew 与等长组 spread,但没有任何路径能**建**这两类约束
——于是纯 CLI 驱动的板子上,那两个数组永远是空的,测量能力等于空转。平台其实早就给了
全套 `@beta` API(真机 probe:create/delete/getAll 都返回 true 且回读得到),是我们没做。

新 7 个 typed action + 两组 Cobra 子命令:

```
easyeda pcb diff-pair create --name USB0 --positive USB_DP --negative USB_DM
easyeda pcb diff-pair list | rename --name USB0 --to USB | delete --name USB
easyeda pcb eq-group  create --name DDR_ADDR --nets A0,A1,A2
easyeda pcb eq-group  list | add --name DDR_ADDR --nets A3,A4 | delete --name DDR_ADDR
```

每个 mutation 都按本仓库的规矩来:

- **前置校验网名**:约束指向一个板上不存在的网,平台照收不误但等于没建 —— 现在动手前
  先比对 `pcb_Net.getAllNetsName()`,对不上**一个字节都不写**就拒绝并列出缺失网名;
- **写后回读**:平台返回的 boolean 不算证据,每次写完重读 `getAll` 比对,回执给 `verified`;
  回读对不上直接报错而不是假报成功;
- **幂等**:同名同内容重建 = `alreadyExists`(可重放);同名不同内容 = 明确拒绝并给出下一步
  (改名 / 先删 / 用 `eq-group add` 扩展),不静默覆盖;
- **部分应用**:`eq-group add` 若有的网落地有的没落地,回 `partial` + `notApplied`(画布已变
  就不抛错,#151 约定),不整批回滚。

读侧统一走 `constraintList` 归一化 —— 平台自 v3.4 起 `getAllDifferentialPairs` 可能返回
**对象 map 而非数组**(官方标注的破坏性变更),两种形态都得当成同一份清单,否则形态一变
就会读成「板上没有约束」。

## [1.2.3] — 2026-08-25

> 1.2.2 只在 dev 循环里打过包(未发版),它的条目并入本版。

### Fixed — 放置器件时就把属性值带上,不再等到 PCB 侧 `sync-attrs`(#186)

`sch_PrimitiveComponent.create` 把 device 记录的 otherProperty **键结构**复制到实例上,
**但值全空**。真机实测一颗 C0805:实例上 `Value` / `Tolerance` / `Voltage Rating` /
`Datasheet` / `Description` 键都在、全是 `""`,而同一刻 `lib_Device.get` 返回的记录里
`Value: "10uF"`、`Tolerance: "±10%"`、`Voltage Rating: "50V"` 一应俱全。后果是 BOM 的
值列与器件标准化面板一路空着,要等流程很后面的 PCB `sync-attrs` 才补 —— **而那份记录
在放置当刻就在手里**。

现在 place 落件后立刻回填(同 #157 supplierId 回填的 best-effort 契约:回填失败绝不让
放置失败),回执多一个 `otherPropertyBackfilled: [...]`。

判据与 PCB 侧 `sync-attrs` **收成同一把尺**(`PROJECTED_STATE_KEYS` +
`planOtherPropertyBackfill` 提到模块级共享,原先只存在于 PCB handler 内部):

- **投影键永不写**:库记录自带占位 `Designator: "C?"` 与模板 `Name: "={Value}"`,
  而平台会把 `otherProperty.Designator` 同步进位号 —— 这正是曾把 166/166 真位号
  洗成 `U?/C?/RF?` 的那条路;写入时同一 call 重新断言真实位号,双保险;
- **只填实例上已有的键**:平台 create 已经把「这颗件该有哪些属性」的键集复制好了,
  不新增键 ⇒ 结构上不可能把库占位漏到新实例;
- **不覆盖已有值**:手改与后续标准化都优先于库记录;
- **幂等**:填过一遍第二遍零动作。

**同一 call 重新断言 `designator` + `supplierId`**:整包 otherProperty 写会让平台
**重新投影顶层字段**。designator 那条是已知的(上面 166/166);`supplierId` 这条是本次
真机回读**当场抓到的回归** —— 第一版只断言了 designator,结果实例的 C 号被打回平台默认
`GRM21BR61H106KE43L.1`(正是 #157 要消灭的不可下单值),**而回执还印着
`supplierIdBackfilled: C440198`**。同一块板上的前后对照:C99(旧构建)`supplierId=<MPN>.1`,
C98(修复后)`supplierId=C440198`,两者 `Value` 都是 `10uF`。
**教训照旧:回执不算数,回读才算数。**

7 个新离线单测钉住上述每一条(含 166/166 位号洗白的回归、陈旧占位 Designator 清洗)。

## [1.2.1] — 2026-08-25

### Added

- **`sch check` 新规则 `polarity-convention-outlier`(WARN,#183 第一阶段)—— 同页电容电源脚约定一致性检查**。
  一颗钽电容正极接 GND 曾带着 51 条 WARN 顺利过 gate,打样上电约 10 秒后热失控才发现——DRC 看不见极性、
  静态测量兆欧级测不出、现象带延迟。该规则的判据**不需要器件极性领域知识**:同页同类两脚电容中,
  「一脚电源轨 + 一脚 GND」的多数派对"电源侧在哪个 pin 号"有强约定,违背多数派的那颗就是 #183 描述的
  8:1 强信号。保守阈值防误报:命中样本 <3 不报(无约定可言)、多数派并列不报(歧义)、多数派占比 <75%
  不报(`--strict` 会把 WARN 升级为阻塞,不允许掷硬币);串联/信号电容(两脚都不是电源地)天然排除,
  候选口径 C+数字编号(CN 端子/CR 二极管不进票仓),地网分类含全拼 GROUND;`totalMatched`
  只计真正进入统计的器件。已知限制:`--all-pages` 下候选跨页池化成一个约定而非逐页统计
  (gate 默认单页不受影响),该模式下 finding message 会注明。finding 带 `pins`(电源脚,地脚)+ `nets` + 多数派归因,message
  明确提示 MLCC 无极性可忽略;summary 新增 `polarityConventionOutliers`,Go 渲染端新增计数槽与修复提示行。
  纯函数 `detectPolarityConventionOutliers` / `isGroundLikeNet` / `isPowerRailNet` 可离线单测
  (8 个新用例含 #183 九电容真机复现)。ERROR 级极性判定(需封装/符号证据)留待 #183 第二阶段。

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-25

> 1.1.2 从未发版(无 tag),它的条目并入本版。
> **升级方式**:CLI/skill 跑 `easyeda update`;**连接器 sideload 必须手工重导入**
> (同 uuid 更新要先在「已安装」里卸载旧的,导入后完全退出并重启 EasyEDA)。

### Added — 版本一致性门:工具链错位当场拒绝并给出修法

CLI / daemon / 连接器三方版本对不上时,`easyeda health` 给出 `versionGate` 判定,
后续动作在 `/action` 层被直接拒绝并附修法,而不是让人先怀疑电路或工具坏了。
明知故犯的逃生口是 `--skip-version-check`(会写审计)。

### Added — S0 spec 位号回填进流程,不用再「每次落块回头改 json」

`modules[].parts` 写的是 designator,而平台会在 create 时按自己的全局位号重编
(计划 C1 → 落地 C11)。位号对不上**不会报错**,只会让分区打分/连接器规则静默少算
一个模块。现在 `sch block-apply --spec <s0.json>` 落块即回填,或事后
`easyeda spec backfill … --write`;写入是外科手术(只替换那一段字节,键序/缩进/
未知字段一个不动),任一模块定位不到就整体拒写。

### Added — `--force-stale-read`:STALE_READ 的逃生口从「不存在的 flag」变成真的

此前拒绝消息里印着一个并不存在的 flag,照抄跑不通。现在它是真 flag,带理由入审计,
且**只放 PCB 读**、解不开布线阶段门。

## [1.1.2] — 2026-08-24

### Fixed — 超时守卫改由 worker tick 兜底:队首卡死不再拖死整条队列

真机连续四次「连接器在负载下停摆」查到底了,**根因不在重连、不在 WebSocket、也不在
daemon**,而在**主线程 setTimeout 在后台窗口里被节流/冻结**,于是连接器所有基于
setTimeout 的守卫(FIFO 的放弃闸 22s、每次平台调用的 `withTimeout` 7s)到点不响。

证据(2026-08-24 三份 daemon 日志 + 审计逐条对齐):

- 09:10:47 一条 `schematic.power.connect_pin` 进入 FIFO 队首,队列**一动不动 6 分钟**;
- 同一时间**心跳一拍不落**(退化前后都是 3.00s/次,它由 Web Worker tick 驱动),
  **旁路读 `document.current` 每次 12ms 就回** —— WS、主线程、`eda.*` 桥全都活着;
- 排在后面的 12 条 `schematic.pages.list`(本身 p50 只有 15ms)**每条各烧满 18s**
  才报 "connector did not respond",合计白等 216 秒;
- 队首终于 settle 后,积压的 12 条**按 FIFO 顺序一次性冲出来,全部 ok:true**;
- 队首那条的错误码是 `EDA_*` 而**不是 `ACTION_ABANDONED`** —— 三份日志与全部审计
  记录里 `ACTION_ABANDONED` 出现 **0 次**:放弃闸自上线以来一次都没响过。

修法:新增 `src/deadlines.ts`,把所有「到点必须发生」的守卫登记成**绝对时刻**,
`setTimeout` 只当快路径,**worker tick 的 `sweepDeadlines()` 是保底路径** —— 那是本
进程里唯一被真机证明不受后台节流影响的时基(看门狗当初正是为此搬进 Worker 的,
只是队列和 per-op 守卫被落在了老路上)。`action-queue` 的放弃闸与 `actions.ts` 的
`withTimeout` 一并改用它。保底路径的分辨率是一拍(3s),所以短守卫最坏晚一拍触发
——远好过晚六分钟。

**行为变化**:队首卡死时,连接器现在会在 `timeoutMs + 2s` 真的放弃它并回
`ACTION_ABANDONED`,队列继续流动。收到这个码 = 那次写的效果**可能稍后才落地**,
关于它的任何结论都不成立(`seqAbandoned` 已递增),必须回读复核后再决定,**不要盲重试**。

### Fixed — 两处「两把尺」:state 身份靠名字背 / block-apply 落点只看器件本体

- **state 身份**:工程被同名删除重建后,旧工程的页记账会继续参与跨页匹配,让
  `spec backfill` / 分区打分把死页算进分母。新增 `easyeda workflow pages --reap`
  (拿活体页表核销)与 `--prune`(清数据);核销后的页会被 WARN 点名并**明确排除出分母**。
- **block-apply 落点**:落点搜索此前只把「器件本体」当障碍,不算 marker 晕圈,于是
  同一页先落主控再落 LED 会撞出图元重叠。现在为 marker 预留约 105 单位——
  **副作用是落点可能离 `--at` 更远**,挤的时候跑 `sch clusters` 看组间压没压到。

### Fixed — zone-draw 拒画:规划器自己造的违规先让掉,拒了也要说得出挪多少

两个内容分得开、只是版面余量对撞的区,现在直接画得出框。真画不出时报文给出逐条
最小位移(`sch zone move --zone X --dy +N`)。版面知识:**竖着叠的两个功能区之间要留
≥96 单位**(24 边距 + 42 说明带 + 30 区名带),横着排的贴着放也画得出框。

### Fixed — 电路说明不再被甩出分区框;`missing-partition` 改看画布而非本地记账

说明带的三把尺收敛成一把;`sch check` 的分区判据改由**画布上的区标题文本**作证
(与 `zone-draw` 生成标题同一个函数),消除「画布上明明有框、check 永远说没有」的恒报。
同时新增 `page-too-small` 判据:块/组比整页可用区还大时**停手交回用户**(拆页是设计决策,
工具不自动分页)。

### Known issues — 随版本如实公布

一次广度优先的端到端(esp32Mini 固定用例)记了 19 条挂账,完整台账见仓库
`docs/reviews/e2e-round-2026-08-25-findings.md`。**升级前值得先知道的三条**:

- **`sch group-move --ids` 报「电气自检失败」却不回滚**:位移照样落地,留下悬空脚 +
  悬空树。看到那个 `✗` **不要当作没发生**,先 `sch bridge-check` 复核画布。
  单件带线搬请改用 `sch group create` + `--group`,或 `disconnect → modify → connect`。
- **`sch destagger --apply` 在相邻引脚场景仍会共线合并成短路**,且「已按快照自动恢复」
  这句话在没真恢复时也会打印。跑完必须 `sch bridge-check` 验一遍。
- **`sch gate --strict` 目前无法出 `verdict=pass`**:`missing-titleblock` 的唯一处方
  (写图签)当前被 design-flow 禁用,平台 DRC 又只回聚合数没法清零。**用非 strict 档**,
  把这两类如实写进交付摘要。

## [1.1.1] — 2026-08-21

### Docs — SKILL.md 顶部写清「这个 skill 单独装上没用」+ 连接器下载地址

从 skill 市场(skillhub / ClawHub)装到这份 skill 的人,拿到的只是**指挥说明**——
真正干活的是本机 `easyeda` CLI/daemon 和 EasyEDA Pro 里的**连接器插件**,两个外部件
一个都不能少。此前顶部只在一句话里夹带了插件市场链接,没有可直接照做的安装步骤。

现在写成三步:① 一行装 CLI;② 连接器 `.eext` **两个下载入口**——立创EDA官方插件市场
(一键装、可原地自动更新,但**版本可能滞后** CLI)与 GitHub Release 直下(与 CLI **严格
同版**,四件套同版以它为准),并写明「同 uuid 更新必须先卸载旧的、导入后必须完全退出重启
EasyEDA」这两个静默失败点;③ 开「允许外部交互」并用 `easyeda health` 验证。

CLI / daemon / 连接器行为**无改动**,纯文档版本。

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-21

本版把 `1.0.3`–`1.0.5` 三个未发布的中间版本一并放出。**minor 而非 patch,因为下面
第一条是行为破坏性变更** —— 升级后一批此前「能跑」的 PCB 读会开始报错。

### ⚠️ BREAKING — 铁律 5 从劝告升成机械门:PCB 脏读现在被**拒绝**

PCB mutation(rip-up / route / delete / via / track / pour)之后、`easyeda doc reload`
之前的 PCB 读(list / DRC / report / nets …),会被 daemon 在 `/action` 派发层**拒绝**,
错误码 `STALE_READ`。此前它只是一行非阻塞的 stderr 警告。

**为什么升门(有实测,不是拍脑袋)**:把 49 天 / 171554 条审计记录里每条铁律的**遵守率**
和它在 SKILL.md 里占的**篇幅**对齐,两者完全反相关 —— 有 daemon 拦截的阶段门(铁律 14)
7 次跳步全被拦、0 漏网;而只发警告的铁律 5 被违反 **1780 次(18.1%)**。文字铁律的
天花板约 82%,机械门是 100%。

**拒绝消息自带能直接执行的下一步**,不只指路:

```
pcb.components.list —— PCB 自 pcb.line.create 后未 reload,读到的是旧引擎状态。
下一步: easyeda doc reload --project ceshi
(绕过: --force-reason "<理由>",入审计)
```

- **升级后要注意的**:布完线直接跑 `easyeda workflow advance` / `pcb check` /
  `layout-score` 会撞 `STALE_READ`。**这不是命令坏了** —— 在旧引擎状态上判 check 门
  本来就是假绿灯。先 `easyeda doc reload` 再跑。
- **豁免**:`pcb.save` / `pcb.pour.rebuild` / 任何 `--dry-run` 预览 / 只改视图的
  `view-side`·`layers set-current`·`layers visibility` / `pcb.snapshot`(它仍只带
  advisory —— 截图白帧的修法是**切前台**而不是 reload,拒它等于递一条修不好问题的命令)。
- **绕过**:`--force-reason "<理由>"`,审计里记成 `daemon.stale_read.force` 伪动作行。
- 内部的「写后回读验证」类命令(`pcb refine` / `sync-designators` / `import-changes` /
  `power-planes` / `power-pour` / `route-critical` / `autoroute` / `pcb clear` /
  playbook `verify:` 块)已逐条加上**窄到一次调用**的放行位,不受影响;而 `refine`
  下一轮开头的规划读等**仍然被拦** —— 那正是这道门要防的。

### Changed — `STAGE_BLOCKED` 的拒绝消息也带上补门命令

此前只说「see `easyeda workflow status`」,现在直接给出该跑哪条:
`pcb stage confirm-tier` / `confirm-outline` / `pcb layout-lint --gate` /
`workflow advance`,按缺的是哪道门决定。

### Fixed — `copperLayerCount` 读不到时不再静默按 2 层降级

板子若在命令开跑前就脏,一块 4 层板会被当成 2 层,于是走 `power-pour` 而不是
`power-planes`,两条电源轨挤在同一层 —— 正是内电层要解决的那个冲突。现在会把降级
明确说出来。

### Changed — 连接器端口钉死 60832 + 指数退避

见下方 `[1.0.5]` 条目全文。摘要:daemon 重启后的重连从「十几秒」降到 **~2-3s**;
顺带修掉「`SLOW_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 10s` 因为看门狗每 3s 抢先调用而从未真正生效」。

### Added — skill 发布链路

- 适配 **Agent Skills 官方规范**:补齐 `license` / `compatibility` / `metadata`
  三个字段,`skills-ref validate` 通过;版本号随 `make release` 自动同步。
- **skillhub.cn 走 CI 自动发布**(订正旧结论「skillhub 无 CLI」——现在有真 CLI):
  `release: published` → `.github/workflows/publish-skill.yml`。slug 为
  `eda-agent-connector`,与立创插件市场的连接器条目同名。

## [1.0.5] — 2026-08-20

### Changed — 端口钉死 60832 + 指数退避重连(不再横扫 10 个口)

**daemon 重启后的重连从「十几秒」变成「秒级」。** daemon 早就只绑 **一个** 固定端口
60832 且**从不外溢**(`internal/app/cmd_daemon.go`:60832 被占就替换/拒绝,绝不换个口
悄悄再起一个),但连接器这头还在扫 `60832-60841` 全段。60833-60841 **结构上不可能**
有 daemon,扫它们是纯空转 —— 而 `eda.sys_WebSocket.register()` **从不报告「连接被拒」**,
每个死端口都要烧满整个 `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`。用户真实插件日志(2026-08-20 23:41)
里,光走 5 个死端口就花了 7 秒,且 `make dev`(air)**每改一次 `.go` 就要重连一次**。

- **只试 60832**:默认端口表长度固定为 1。
- **指数退避**:首次立即,失败后 0.5s → 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s 封顶,各带 ±25% 抖动。
  一次尝试成本 ≈ 200ms(REGISTER_DELAY_MS)+ 1500ms(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS),
  所以 daemon 重启这种「一两秒就回来」的常见场景稳定在 **~2-3s 内重连**;真的长时间
  没有 daemon 时则退到 8s 一次的安静轮询,对 EasyEDA 共享 socket 表的压力比原来固定
  3s 轻约 3 倍,也比原来 10s 的慢轮询恢复更快。
- **退避是真的生效的**:新增 `nextAttemptAt` 时间闸。看门狗每 3s 就会调一次重连,
  原来的 `SLOW_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 10s` 因此**从来没有真正慢下来过**(定时器排的时间被
  看门狗抢先)。现在所有非强制入口都要过这道闸;**手动重连 / 窗口回到前台 / 退避定时器
  到点**这三条是强制路径,不受闸限制。
- **换 wsId 的阈值 2 → 4**:一次「失败」过去是 ~18s 的整轮扫描,现在是 ~1.7s 的单次
  尝试。阈值不动会把换 id 的节奏压到几秒一次,在 EasyEDA 共享的 socket 表里堆死 id
  —— 正是这段逻辑当初要躲的 race。
- **逃生口(没有焊死)**:扩展用户配置 `daemonPorts` 可覆盖端口 ——
  `eda.sys_Storage.setExtensionUserConfig('daemonPorts', '60832-60841')`、
  `'60840,60832'`、`60900` 都认;每次尝试开始时**实时读取**,改完下一轮重试就生效,
  不必重装 `.eext`、不必重启 EasyEDA。坏值一律退回钉死的默认;覆盖列表封顶 12 个口
  (手滑写 `1-65535` 不能把重连变成无尽扫描)。`60832-60841`(`0xEDA0`-`0xEDA9`)
  仍是我们保留的专属段,依旧刻意远离官方 `eext-run-api-gateway` 的 `49620-49629`。
- 回归测试 `src/transport-ports.test.ts`(离线,12 条)钉住:默认表长度必须为 1、
  退避阶梯与封顶、抖动边界、逃生口解析与去重上限、多端口时 lastGood 优先。

## [1.0.4] — 2026-08-20

### Changed — 动作串行化(FIFO)+ 放弃机制 + 顺序证据三字段

**行为变化,读写对齐的地基。** 此前连接器**并发处理动作**:
`transport.ts` 把每条 WebSocket 消息交给各自的 onMessage 回调,而 `await`
不跨回调排队,于是两条动作可以同时在飞。用真 transport.ts + 假 `eda` 全局跑的
探针实测(2026-08-20):写还没 settle,读的 handler 已经开跑,响应也先发了出去。
结果就是「先发写、再发读」在连接器里**不构成任何先后关系** —— 一次回读报
「那里什么都没有」,既可能是真的没有,也可能是读得太早,两者在观测上完全等价。

- **真 FIFO**:所有动作走 `handleRequest` 这一个咽喉,每窗口一条显式 promise 链,
  一次只跑一个 handler。回归测试 `src/transport-fifo.test.ts` 驱动真 transport
  钉住这一条。
- **放弃机制**(与 FIFO 同等重要):队首超过**请求自带的 `timeoutMs`**(+2s 宽限,
  晚于 daemon 自己的超时)仍未 settle,就放弃等待它、`seqAbandoned++`、队列继续
  流动,并回一条 `ACTION_ABANDONED`。**截止时间绝不写死常数** —— `sch check`/DRC
  这类合法长操作能跑 60s+,固定门会把它们全误杀。没有这条,一个永不 resolve 的
  handler 会吞掉后续一切(真机见过:一次卡死让接下来 4.5 分钟的
  place/delete/document.open 全部静默消失,而轻读照常)。
- **顺序证据三字段**:每一条 response frame 新增 `seq`(已完成动作数,本动作完成
  之后的值,单调递增)、`seqAbandoned`(累计被放弃数)、`unordered`(可选,true =
  这条响应走了旁路通道、其 seq 不构成顺序证据),外加便利字段 `abandonedIds`
  (最近 ≤32 条被放弃的 request id,让判定能点名而不只是数数)。
- **旁路通道**:`document.current` 一条(名单短、理由写在 `action-queue.ts`)。
  纯读、代价恒定、且「读得太早」的失败方向安全(它只会报旧页面让 `--doc` 门重试,
  不可能谎报已切到目标页)。wedge 期「轻读还能用」是唯一的观测手段,不能因为串行化
  而失去。旁路响应**必须**打 `unordered`。
- **溢出保护**:队列积压上限 64,满了回 `QUEUE_OVERFLOW`(该动作**没有执行**),
  不无限堆积。

**seq 证明什么、不证明什么(别越界)**:它只证明「W 的 handler 在 R 的 handler
开跑前就 settle 了」——**不是**「文档已提交」。`eda.*` 可能在 handler 返回后才落盘,
那一层我们没有观测点。CLI 侧所有基于 seq 的措辞都停在这条边界内。

**版本搭配**:
- **老 CLI + 新连接器** —— 正常。三个字段是**新增的顶层字段**,老 daemon 解析响应
  时直接忽略;FIFO/放弃对老 CLI 是纯粹的行为改善(不再有并发写读交错,卡死的队首
  不再吞掉后续动作)。唯一可见差异:极端积压时会收到 `QUEUE_OVERFLOW`,老 CLI 把它
  当普通失败报出。
- **老连接器 + 新 CLI** —— 正常,但**判定降级**。`sch block-apply` 的 place 超时
  收编会发现响应不带 `seq`/`seqAbandoned`,自动退回原来的探针启发式,并在报文里
  打上「证据档:弱(探针启发式)」+ 升级连接器的下一步。**绝不会**因为缺字段就默认
  「新鲜」。侧载的 `.eext` 与 CLI 严格同版;市场装的那份可能滞后若干 minor,那就是
  会落到这一档的典型情形。

### 随版 CLI 侧修复(连接器无关)

本条记录随版 CLI 侧对「删除/组注册」三缺陷(esp32Mini E2E
交接报告 §六 缺陷 2/3/4)的修复,便于版本对照:

- **删器件级联删组注册(缺陷 2,P1)**:虚拟组注册表存在 **Go 侧**
  (`workflow.State.GroupsByPage`,`~/.easyeda-agent/workflow/<project>.json`),
  连接器的 component.delete 级联(ADR-0004 Decision 5,只清桩线/flag)够不到它。
  现在 `sch prim-delete` 与 block-apply 回滚在**回读证实删除成功后**同步摘除该
  位号的成员记录(指向死位号的 role 一并摘,组删净则删组)——位号复用不再被
  陈旧组吃掉。
- **删除不可靠→逐个删+回读证实+重试一次(缺陷 3,P1)**:平台批量 delete 静默
  no-op 仍返 true(真机:zone-draw 删旧框 survived=4、回滚 deleted=false,逐个删
  100% 成功)。Go 侧新增 `deleteVerifiedOneByOne` 统一语义;block-apply 回滚改
  逐个 `component.delete`,zone-draw 删旧框/绘制回滚的 exec_js 内联同一套
  逐个删+重试。判定只信回读。
- **`sch group create --block-id/--instance/--roles`(缺陷 4,P1)**:组注册损坏后
  可手工重登块溯源(与 block-apply 自动登记同一批字段),`sch reconcile` 恢复
  机械对账(reconcile 需要 --block-id **加** --roles ROLE=位号)。

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-19

ADR-0004「挪动收敛为单一安全 move 内核」首批随版(源自 issue #181 两份 E2E
复盘)。CLI 侧:schMoveKernel 五步管线(快照→删证回读→snap 移动→快照重连→
电气对账,失败自动恢复、目标页失效 fail-closed),group-move/zone move/
zone-arrange/relayout/**destagger(解禁)**五命令收敛为内核调用方,
`group-move --groups` 多子组一次整体移动;`--zone/--group` 统一命名空间
(一张注册表+来源标签,报错列全量可用名);dry-run 纯计算机械保证(派发层
拒 Mutates)。连接器侧两条见下。

### Fixed
- **`pcb.component.modify` 解锁假成功(#174)**:平台 `modify()` 的真实锁字段是
  `primitiveLock`,而我们的读侧(`pcb list`)一直报 `locked`,调用方自然传
  `{"locked":false}` —— 平台**静默忽略未知键仍返回成功**(真机 22/22 报 ok、
  reload 后 22/22 仍锁定)。现在:(1) patch 归一化,`locked`/`lock` 别名映射到
  官方键 `primitiveLock`,契约外的未知键**硬报错**(不再允许静默 no-op);
  (2) 每次写后**新鲜回读**逐字段核对(modify 返回对象会回显输入,不可信),结果
  带 `verified` + `applied`/`notApplied`/`unverified`;(3) 回读发现锁写被丢时
  自动改走 `setState_PrimitiveLock` + `done()` 写路径(`pcb.track.lock` 验证过
  的模式)重试并再核对(`lockFallback:true`);(4) 按 #151 部分应用约定:画布
  已变(部分字段落地)返回 ok + 结构化 `notApplied`,**零字段落地才报 ERROR**。

### Added
- **`schematic.component.delete` 级联清理(ADR-0004 Decision 5)**:删件后自动
  找出**只**挂在被删件 pin 上的桩线树(union-find 共点归树 + 点到线段锚定,与
  bridge-check 同一套判定)以及挂在这些树上的 netflag/netport/netlabel,一并
  删除并回读证实。树若还触及任何**存活**器件的 pin 即视为共享,绝不删;被删件
  自身残留(删除撒谎)时其树也整体跳过。结果新增
  `cascaded: {wires:[ids], flags:[ids]}`(只列**回读证明已删**的 id);级联删除
  撒谎的存活 id 按 #151 部分应用约定计入 `notApplied`(ok 保持 true + warning)。
  根治「删件残留桩线/旗被后放件静默继承网名」的幽灵连接(v1.0.1 的 orphan-tree
  判据只能事后抓,现在事前防)。CLI 渲染点(prim-delete / block-apply 回滚)
  带一行「级联清理 N 桩线 M 旗」。
- **`schematic.component.delete` 新 payload 字段 `cascade:false`(退路)**:保持
  旧行为(只删组件本体,不碰桩线/旗)——自己管整树删除的调用方(如 ADR-0004
  的 move 内核)必须传它,避免级联与内核的整树管理相互踩踏。默认 `cascade:true`。

- **`pcb.component.lock` — 批量组件锁定/解锁(#174)**:输入 `primitiveIds[]` +
  `locked`,走专用 `setState_PrimitiveLock` + `done()` 写路径,写后新鲜回读逐件
  核对;结果 `applied`/`alreadyInState`/`notApplied`/`missing` + `verified`。
  幂等(已在目标状态的只计数不重写);全部未落地时报 ERROR 而非假成功。CLI:
  `easyeda pcb lock --ids id1,id2 [--unlock]` / `easyeda pcb lock --all --unlock`
  (整板批量释放,--all 由 CLI 读活板 component 列表展开)。

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-18

连接器侧一条修复(见下);CLI 侧同批落地:artifact 目录递归嵌套归一、
`--doc` 对读命令生效、`board.rebind` 目录补登记(UNKNOWN_ACTION 出口补审计)、
裸 `sch connect` 35s 预算 + 慢速落地复核(slowLanded)、`sch group-move`
半途失败自动重连恢复、`sch note --zone` 框满走廊落点、`sch autoconnect`
带痕候选 WARN + `--strict`。

### Fixed
- **`schematic.pin.disconnect` 假成功**:此前删除只调 delete 后不回读,平台对
  并入共享树/共线段的桩线**静默 no-op 仍返 true**,动作照样报
  `disconnected:true`(真机复现:R5:1 / R5:2 / C4:2 断开后网表仍连)。且坐标
  定位只取第一根触脚导线就 break,同脚多桩场景天然漏删。现在:(1) 收集**全部**
  触及目标 pin 端点的导线一起删;(2) 删除后 getAll 回读验证,存活即按部分应用
  约定返回结构化 partial(`ok:true` + `partial:true` + `notApplied`/
  `survivedIds`,`disconnected` 仅在全部证实消失时为 true,`deletedWires`/
  `deletedFlags` 只计证实删除的 id)并附 warnings;CLI `sch disconnect` 把
  partial 渲染为醒目 stderr 警告(不再静默成功)。

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-18

**里程碑:原理图功能正式上线(S0–S6 可交付)。** 版本从 0.26.x 跃迁至 1.0.0,
连接器与 CLI/skill 同版(四件套同版约定)。0.26.1 未单独发布,其连接器变更
(`schematic.bridgeCheck` 的 `ORPHAN_TREE` 悬空树判据,见下方 0.26.1 条目)随本版
一并发布。1.0.0 的主体变更在 CLI/skill 侧:三层布局体系(Sheet→Zone→Group,
分区框/区名/电路说明算法落位,生成与校验同一把尺)、`sch gate --strict` 五关
机械门禁、跨页网名审计 `sch nets --strict`、块对账 `sch reconcile`、netlist
黄金表逐脚比对;esp32Mini 真机端到端回归通过(3 页 / 26 件 / 18 网全对)。
连接器 0.26.x 与本版 CLI 协议兼容,但 `orphan-tree` 判据需本版连接器才生效。

## [0.26.1] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **`schematic.bridgeCheck` 新判据 `ORPHAN_TREE`(悬空树)**:wire 树不触任何
  引脚 —— 挪件残留(flag+桩线随器件移动被遗留原地)或纯裸死线。此前
  `ORPHAN`(要求树触到引脚)与 `ORPHAN_FLAG`(要求 flag 不挨任何导线)对这种
  形态**结构性盲区**:真机 2026-08-18 P2_MCU 页两棵 GND flag+桩线残留树,
  bridge-check 连报 0 orphan,靠渲染图人工数 flag 才抓到。summary 新增
  `orphanTrees` 计数;CLI ≥ 同版把它渲染为 `orphan-tree`(WARN,gate `--strict`
  阻塞)。旧 CLI 读新连接器只是忽略新字段,不破坏兼容。

## [0.26.0] - 2026-08-17

**连接器侧无代码变更** —— 版本号随 CLI 同步(四件套同版约定)。本版全部变更在
CLI/skill 侧:`sch zone-arrange`(功能区确定性布局两段求解 + `--apply` 断言门)、
`sch status`/`sch nets`/`sch reconcile`/`sch clusters`/`audit cost` 新子命令、
图框(sheet)误删双层守卫与 `sch titleblock --data` 写入禁用令(写路径会损毁
sheet 符号引用,重启后图框丢失 —— 修复处方见 skill actions.md)、原理图 SOP
步骤卡。连接器 0.25.x 与本版 CLI 完全兼容。

### Changed
- **许可证正式落地为 MIT**：此前仓库根本没有 `LICENSE` 文件(GitHub 视角 = 版权
  全保留,严格讲不是开源),声明只散落在 `NOTICE`/清单里且互相打架(根
  `package.json` 写 MIT、连接器写 Apache-2.0)。现在补齐根 `LICENSE`(MIT),
  `extension.json` 的 `license` 随之改为 `MIT`、`package.json` 改为 SPDX 复合
  表达式 `(MIT AND Apache-2.0)`。**例外**:`src/beautify/` 下四个文件移植自
  Easy_EDA_PCB_Beautify(m-RNA),继续沿用 Apache-2.0 —— 无权改,也不必改(两者
  兼容)。许可证全文放在 `src/beautify/LICENSE`,`.eext` 包内新增 `extension/
  LICENSE` 承载 MIT 全文 + 第三方告知(`dist/` 里含 beautify 的编译产物)。

## [0.25.1] - 2026-08-13

修复立创插件市场审核驳回「README图片未加载成功，请检查存储路径」(0.24.0 被拒)。

### Fixed
- **README 演示图改用平台图床绝对链接**：三张演示图从包内相对路径
  `images/demo-*.png|gif` 改为 `https://image.lceda.cn/extensions/images/...`。
  根因不在路径写法——0.23.0 用同一份 README 过审，包内容三版字节级一致；
  真因是市场服务端解析 `.eext` 时的「README 抽图 → 转存图床 → 改写链接」
  那一步偶发失败：过审的 0.23.0 库里 readme 字段是 `image.lceda.cn` 绝对
  链接，被拒的 0.24.0 则没有 readme 记录，审核员打开就是三个裂图。改用
  平台自家图床的绝对链接后不再依赖那一步（链接本身正是平台为 0.23.0
  转存生成的，字节与包内图片一致）。图片文件仍随包发布（`images/` 保留，
  logo 走 manifest 的 `./images/logo.jpg` 不变）。

## [0.25.0] - 2026-08-12

原理图布局体系定版:placement-first 区级重排(`sch zone relayout`)+ 串联链
共线串接 + 全员竖放平行对齐 + 顺方向 netport + 竖直旗真值表修正 + 三个新判据
(reversed-net-flag / marker-overlap 文字带 / redundant-net-marker)。
连接器含 0.24.1–0.24.5 全部修复(合并线段对解析三处统一/orphan-stub 直连豁免)。

### Added(CLI 侧,串联链 chain——用户拍板「一串完成不折弯」)
- **relayout 识别 pin-to-pin 直连链**(如 GND—LED—R—netport):全链共线横放
  串接,相邻 pin 短直线、零折弯;地端在左(旗竖直向下)、netport 端在右
  (水平顺链向);极性件(LED)rot 按「链左 pin 实测在左」消解。链宽超区带
  报错提示手动分段(断点两侧同名 netport 对、2+2 分行)——能一串就一串,
  不主动加标签。
- **band 生长障碍钳制修复**:旧判据只认「完全在外侧」的障碍,初始 inflate
  相交的邻区被忽略 → 生长穿透邻区腹地(实测 LED band 穿进 MCU 区,链件摆进
  别人家)。凡与 band 正交区间相交且伸过边缘的障碍一律钳制,已相交钳在原地。

### Changed(CLI 侧,netport 顺方向摆布——用户拍板,取代「永不竖放」铁则)
- **netport 顺导线方向摆布**:竖放件的 netport 顺竖直引出(rotation 走
  orientation port 真值表 up=90/down=270),不再强制水平——水平引出的 L 形
  正是件间距不等的根源;现在全员回归 60 等距完全平行。旧铁则「netport 永不
  竖放」的真实痛点是密集 pin 列上侧向标签互相堆叠——那是拥挤,由
  marker-overlap(netport 平台 bbox 天然含文字)管;folded-net-label 判据
  恒零(函数与 summary 字段保留,报表兼容),layout-score folded 维恒满分。
- 相关测试翻转为语义变更回归钉(竖放必须不再报);宿主解析测试改为直测
  hostByNearestPin/hostByWireTrace 纯函数(原借 folded 归因当载体)。

### Changed(CLI 侧,relayout 全员平行布局——用户拍板)
- **外围电容电阻全员竖放、同一行、平行对齐**:此前去耦竖放/信号链横放两种姿势
  (同是电容 C4 竖 C5 横,不工整)。现在 signal 件也转竖放——电源旗端朝上/地旗
  端朝下(与双旗件同轴),netport 从另一端**水平朝左**引出(netport 永不竖放
  不变);全员器件锚 y 相同 = 本体/顶旗/底旗三条线全对齐。间距:纯双旗件 60,
  带 netport 件 110(容水平文字)。双 netport 件(无电源轴)保留横放 fallback。

### Added(CLI 侧,锚 IC 电源旗也守「电上地下」)
- **relayout 收尾把锚 IC 的横躺电源/地旗竖直化**(用户点名:外围都守约定,中心
  器件不能例外)。安全判:竖直桩不穿本件相邻 pin(列顶电源脚/列底地脚才安全),
  不安全的保持横躺并报告。横躺判据用旗**自身 rot**(0/180=竖直)而非 pin→锚
  方向——L 形合流树(pin 横引再竖下挂旗)的竖直旗按方向近似会被误判横躺、
  重连拆散合流(实测 U2 双 GND 合流被误报)。

### Added(CLI 侧,`sch zone relayout` —— placement-first 区级重排,用户点名的正确顺序)
- **新命令 `sch zone relayout --zone X [--apply]`**:与 zone tidy(挪带线的组)
  的根本差别是顺序——①锚 IC 定位定向(V1 不动)→ ②外围器件按角色**纯计算**
  终局(去耦竖放锚右同顶等距 60、信号链横放其下同行基线共线、链宽按 pin 实测
  +网名估)→ ③deep sweep 删净旧桩旗 → 逐件落位 → 一遍性重连(真值表)。
  全程不搬带线的图元,组刚移的 merge 撕裂整类问题不存在。ceshi MCU 区实测:
  任意乱局一条命令到终局,自检绿,gate PASS。
- buildTidyPlan 加 forceAll(全员出计划,幂等 no-op 不短路);tidySignalPlan
  加 HasPose(signal 件执行时先落位再重连)。
- **zoneTidyGrowBand 双序生长**:生长顺序决定 L 形空间里矩形的形状(先纵后横
  把下方长满、右缘被低处图签卡死只剩 404 宽;先横后纵长到 806)。两种顺序都
  算取面积大者;relayout 的 band 无条件生长(分区 rect 是「当前内容」的函数,
  不生长就是鸡生蛋——上轮排成一列,band 缩窄,这轮还是一列)。

### Added(CLI 侧,signal-row 链端电源旗竖直化)
- **group tidy signal-row 升级**:链末端横躺的 power/gnd netflag(left/right)
  一律重连竖直(power 上/gnd 下)——横躺旗的文字竖排侧向渲染(平台特性),
  用户点名三处「文字竖着难看」;竖直化后与去耦列同款风格。已竖直 = no-op。
- **修 signal-row 重建覆盖缺口**:deep sweep 删的是全件的树(两端),但重建
  计划只含被修 pin——netport 端删了没重建 → 悬空(实测 C5/R1/R2 三件同炸)。
  现在有任何修复目标时全部 netport pin 都进重建计划(已水平的按原语义重建)。
- **staging park 位从带右外 +200 改 +500(出纸)**:+200 曾把组 park 进右邻
  功能区腹地(band 右外 ≠ 空地),park 桩与邻区线共点 merge 出跨区短路且回滚
  撕裂扩散到邻区(实测两次,第二次伤到 POWER 的 C3)。纸外无内容可 merge。

### Added(CLI 侧,zone tidy 行内电气基线对齐)
- **横放信号链行内基线共线**:行内对齐从「组 bbox 顶」改为「电气基线」(器件
  锚 y = 桩线 y;行首组定行基线,后续组共线)。bbox 顶对齐时两组上伸量不同
  (GND 旗符号 vs 3V3 旗文字)会让同行两条链的走线错开 5-10 单位(用户点名
  「横竖不齐」第三轮)。竖放组不变(总高已统一,顶齐即底齐);sheet 层无基线,
  行为不变。

## [0.24.5] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **wire-crossing 对平台合并线(segment-array)的伪交叉误报**:collectWireSegments
  把段数组当折线读,在无关段端点之间捏造对角伪段——4 段正交 GND 合流树被报
  「自己跟自己交叉」(伪对角中点)。与 0.24.1 dangling 修复同款解析:偶数顶点
  ≥4 按段对(stride 4),奇数回退折线(stride 2)。wire-over-pin 同管道受益。

### Added(CLI 侧,check 补两个视觉盲区判据——用户第二轮肉眼抓出)
- **reversed-net-flag**:netflag 的 stored rotation 与桩线方向按 orientation
  真值表不符(倒挂/侧翻)→ WARN。此前朝向判据只活在 layout-score(非门),
  gate 的 check 关抓不到反旗;Go 侧表与 orientation.json 的一致性单测钉死
  (再分叉 = 再度双盲)。现场首跑即抓到 EPAD 的 GND 倒挂旗(块 wiring 老表遗毒)。
- **marker-overlap 文字带建模**:平台 getPrimitivesBBox 只包旗符号本体(实测
  GND 旗 10×21,"GND" 文字不在内)——两支旗符号相切、文字互叠时 overlap=0
  静默(U2 双 GND pin 挤成一坨、POWER 区 U1 左三支旗互叠共 4 处全漏)。netflag
  判定 bbox 现 = 符号 ∪ 文字带(位置按朝向:水平旗文字在锚内侧线上方,竖旗
  文字在符号外端居中;宽 6/字符)。现场首跑抓全 4 处。

## [0.24.4] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **竖直旗 rotation 真值修正(2026-06-29 校准错了两个月)**:当时把 cycle 方向
  搞反、用 anchor 对调补救——水平值恰好凑对,竖直值一直反(connect_pin 放的
  朝上 3V3 存 180 渲染倒挂,而 linter 用同一份错表把它判「正确」——生成侧和
  校验侧共享同一个错,机械门全绿、视觉不合格,用户肉眼抓出)。五点真机实测
  (power up=0/right=270/left=90,ground down=0/left=270)确认逆时针 cycle
  `up→left→down→right` + 自然锚 {power:up, ground:down, port:right} 复现全部
  12 个数;相对旧表只有 up/down 翻转,left/right 逐字节不变。orientation.json
  (SSOT)/actions.ts/linter fixtures+goldens 三处同步,derive 一致性单测护住。

### Added(CLI 侧,竖放视觉规整)
- **竖放去耦统一总高**:group tidy 的 power-updown 桩长按 pin 距补偿
  (offset=(100−pin距)/2)——同排组高不一(块 wiring 桩 30 vs autoconnect 默认
  桩 20)顶对齐后底不齐。现在同排竖放组顶线/底线双齐。
- **竖放桶行内间距 40**:竖放组左右无标签文字,117(相向水平标签安全距)的
  语义不适用,排出来松散。

### Added(CLI 侧,zone tidy 组间布局细化)
- **同形态分桶分行**:竖放组(双电源旗去耦,上电下地)与横放组(带 netport 的
  信号链,netport 只能水平)不再按面积混排一行——桶切换强制换行,竖的一排、
  横的一排(用户点名「横着和竖着不规范」;混排顶对齐后高矮参差)。
- **移动次序依赖排序**:组 i 的目标位压着未移组 j 的原位 → j 先走(Kahn,
  有环带外 staging 两跳)。平台会把暂态叠位的共点线 MERGE 成一根,之后再移
  就撕出短路(实测:C5 落到未搬走的 R2 原位,EN/IO0 树合并 multi-net,回滚
  更撕成同点双 netport)。
- **回滚后强制复检 bridge-check**:回滚也是刚移,merge 过的线逆移同样撕——
  红则大字报「板已受损+修复路径」,不再静默留坏板(此前提示人工复核,实测
  漏过一次坏板直到下轮 gate 才发现)。
- zone 方位词 `left-center`/`center-right`/`any` 同步进 `internal/spec.ZoneNames`
  (契约侧;跨包一致性单测抓出的分叉)。

## [0.24.3] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **bridge-check orphan-stub 误报 pin-to-pin 直连线**:无标线树只要触及 ≥2 个
  不同器件 pin 就是合法直连(网得自动名如 `$2N1792`),不再报 orphan——只有
  真·单 pin 空桩才是 dangling(实测:LED 直连线替换相向 netport 对后被误伤,
  `sch gate --strict` 因此挂红)。

### Added(CLI 侧,Sheet 层 + 布局算法通用化)
- **`sch sheet tidy`** Sheet 层布局:全部功能区当刚体依据纸张排布(shelf 行排,
  图签当**障碍物**右跳避让 = L 形可用区,非整条底带让位);band 按分区框最终
  占位收缩(内容外 pad 24 + 标题带 30),区间 vGap 默认 90(两框 pad+标题带
  =78,+缝 12);现状已达标时幂等 no-op;--apply 逐区 zone move + 统一重画框。
- **zone tidy band 自动生长**:区带装不下时向纸面空地四向夹逼生长(避开其他
  分区+图签+纸边,只长不缩)——区带锁死旧分区 rect 会把「区内容要长大」判成
  无解(超高模组锚在 326 高旧带里永远装不下)。
- **zone pack 策略 B(锚侧行排)**:锚下装不下时其余组行排到锚右侧子带——
  40 脚模组这类「超高锚」吃满带高时,去耦/外围贴芯片侧是电气+几何双正确形状。
- **zone 方位词新增 `left-center` / `center-right` / `any`**:跨两列的宽区
  (超高主控锚+侧排外围)原有 1/3 网格词罩不住,逐件 zone-violation 误报。

## [0.24.2] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **group.move 搬迁平台合并线(segment-array)时崩溃**:平台会把共端点同网线
  合并为一条 line=(x1,y1,x2,y2)×N 的多段图元,原样喂回 `create()` 被拒——旧线
  已删、新线没建,组半搬(实测 sheet tidy 首跑 MCU 区在 LED_CTRL 三段合并线上
  阵亡)。现按段拆成 N 次单段 create(平台自行再合并),0 长度填充段跳过,
  分段失败报出已建段数。

### Added(CLI 侧,三层布局体系 —— docs/cli/schematic.md)
- **`sch group tidy`** 组内布局计算:双电源旗电容自动竖放+上电下地+文字朝外
  (真机校准 rotation 表:power up=0/gnd down=0);实测 pin 旋转二义消解、
  stale 双读防线、未建模第三连接拒绝(3-pin 馈通不被扯断)、disconnect 连带
  断开即错、自检红即逐步回滚。
- **`sch zone move`** 功能区整体刚移(带组带件带 note,分区框自动重画):
  全区一份展开治"区内直连线被判跨区留守"的刚体撕裂;重画前几何指纹 settle。
- **`sch zone tidy`** 组间叠加布局:锚组+上下堆叠(hGap=117 可调),装不下
  给最小尺寸诊断;双认领图元差集过滤(正向/回滚对称)。
- 三命令均经独立交叉评审(2 FAIL 修复转绿 + 1 PASS 加固)与 ceshi 真机三层
  联动验收(乱排→tidy 复原/整区 move 单程 check 0 dangling/装不下诊断)。

## [0.24.1] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **dangling 检测对平台合并线(segment-array)误报**:自由端 = 线段图的度 1
  顶点(偶数 ≥4 顶点按线段对解析,奇数回退折线链;闭环退化取首尾)——此前
  把多段合并线当折线读,3 段 L 形合并线的中间顶点被误判成自由端。

## [0.24.0] - 2026-08-12

原理图能力大版:持久化编组 + 布局质量打分 + CLI 参数收敛(含 BREAKING)。
连接器侧含 0.23.1–0.23.3 的全部修复(见下)加本版的 group.move flag 支持与
schematic.snapshot 移除;CLI 侧新增见 repo commit 历史(feat/sch-zoned-layout-opt)。

### Added
- **原理图持久化编组(virtual group)**:`sch group create/list/add/remove/ungroup`
  按 documentUuid 持久化(平台无编组 API,真机探测+UI 实建 Group1 差分复核:
  扩展 API 零可见);`sch group-move --group` 成员桩线+标志自动展开随组刚移
  (完整性预检拒半搬、共线残骸判据、"树终止于异脚"方向判据,live dump 全量
  回放测试);`align/distribute` 部分组硬拒绝(`--break-group` 放行)。
- **`sch layout-score` 布局质量五维打分**:折叠/反向/贴芯片距离/长链/框贴合,
  逐项归因**带可执行 fix 命令**;模块认领感知(zones claims 围栏)、电源网豁免、
  宿主 pin 走导线端点匹配。实战:ceshi 重排 86.2→96.0 [excellent]。
- **`sch check` 新增机械检查**:`missing-partition`(多器件页未画分区框/说明,
  铁律#15 兜底)与 `folded-net-label`(netport 竖排折叠);autoconnect 打分器
  新增竖排折叠惩罚(密集引脚列标签保持水平)。
- 分区框几何修正:图签 keepout 校准(HeightFrac 0.24)+ 抬升/校验共用安全余量
  + 框贴合模块内容 + 贴边校验,六项 validation 全 0 才许画。

### Changed / BREAKING(CLI 与手册配套发版,不留兼容)
- `--ids` 全域改 **CSV**(JSON 数组字符串不再支持);
- `sch delete` 移除(`prim-delete` 唯一删除入口);
- `sch snapshot` / `schematic.snapshot` 移除(出图统一 `sch export-image`,
  选区导出与文档数据逐件核对验证);
- `sch connect` 新增 `--pin 位号:脚号`(与 `--x/--y` 互斥);`sch modify` 新增
  `--x/--y/--rotation/--designator` 快捷 flags。

## [0.23.3] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **`schematic.group.move` 对 netflag/netport 半途崩溃 —— flag 改走 delete+recreate。**
  平台 `sch_PrimitiveComponent.modify` 仅限元件(「仅当器件类型为元件时允许使用该函数
  进行修改」),旧实现把 flag 与元件同锅 modify:碰到第一个 flag 即抛错中断,而平台无
  事务——**此前已 modify 的成员留在新位、其余全没动**(live 实测:R1 连续三次半搬、
  C5 与全部导线原地不动)。修复:预检阶段先把 wantIds 分类并解析每个 flag 的 recreate
  参数(identification/direction 从符号名推:power-*/ground-*/netport-bi|in|out;
  net/rotation/mirror 读实例),**任一成员不可解析(含 netlabel/short_symbol 无
  create API)→ 零变更拒绝**;执行阶段元件 modify、flag delete+createNetFlag/Port
  (rotation 经 appliedRotation 补偿负存储 build)、wire delete+recreate。result 新增
  `movedFlags`。111 单测过。

## [0.23.2] - 2026-08-11

- 版本对齐 bump(hot-reload 部署 0.23.1 修复集时占用的序号),无独立代码变更。

## [0.23.1] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- **`sch modify` 只 patch 顶层字段(如 supplierId)会把自定义属性整体静默清空(#175)。**
  根因:平台 `eda.sch_PrimitiveComponent.modify` 对 `otherProperty` 是**整体重写**
  语义 —— patch 不带 `otherProperty` 时平台直接把现有自定义属性清成空,而 handler
  只在 patch 含 `customAttributes/otherProperty` 时才做 read-merge-write,顶层字段
  补丁原样透传 → 166 件填好的 Value 被一条 `{"supplierId":"C..."}` 全清成 ""、
  `ok=true` 零告警(CLI 文档承诺的 MERGE 语义只兑现了一半)。修复:顶层字段补丁
  同样先回读现有 `otherProperty` 并在**同一次 modify 里原样写回**;全保住时
  `result.propertiesPreserved` + `propertiesBefore` 显式回报被连带重写的键,平台仍
  丢的键走 `partial:true` + `notApplied`(CLI 非零退出)绝不静默;现有属性为空则不
  加 `otherProperty` 键(不做无谓整体写,避开 attrs_backfill 记录过的投影键副作用)。
  验证:单测把平台整体重写语义建进 stub(不带 otherProperty ⇒ 清空)+ 4 个新用例
  (保留写回 / 空属性不写 / 平台仍丢键报 partial / 回读失败降级 verified:false),
  连接器 111 单测全过、`tsc --noEmit` 干净。
- **`export-image` 后编辑器残留「卡在 99%」进度条 —— 导出完成后主动 teardown。**
  根因:导出走 `sch_ManufactureData.getExportDocumentFile`(唯一的矢量+选区+后台
  出图路径,无替代 API),该制造数据管线会弹 BOM/器件库进度条,且**成功返回后
  平台不销毁它**——命令 2-3s 成功、文件正常,但 GUI 的 99% toast 挂着要手动关
  (实测 2/2 复现)。修复:`schematicExportImage` 的导出 `finally` 里延迟 400ms
  best-effort 调 `sys_LoadingAndProgressBar.destroyProgressBar()/destroyLoading()`
  (@public 幂等,已 debug exec 真机验证 showProgressBar(99)→destroy 可清);
  成功场景清 99% 残留,超时场景连卡 1% 的一并清。纯 GUI 清理,不改任何输出。
- **原理图布局「卡进度到 99%」间歇挂死 —— `connect_pin` 平台变异调用补单步超时。**
  根因:EasyEDA 平台 API 偶发**吞掉创建请求但既不 resolve 也不 reject**(与
  `schematicExportImage` 早已用 `withTimeout` 兜的 SCH_EXPORT「platform drops the
  request without rejecting → stuck progress toast」同一失效模式)。`schematic.power.connect_pin`
  的三个平台调用(`sch_PrimitiveWire.create` / `createNetFlag` / `createNetPort`)**没套超时**,
  那句 `await` 就永久挂住;daemon 只能在 ~18s dispatch 预算处以「connector did not respond」
  杀掉该请求,于是 `block-apply` 批量按脚布线时某一脚冻 18s → 用户看到布局进度卡在 ~99%
  (audit 实测 ≈<1/400 次 connect_pin;挂住的那次有时还迟到落盘留下 `$…N…` 孤儿网)。修复:
  三个变异调用各 `withTimeout(7000ms)`(远低于 18s dispatch,`Promise.resolve` 归一重载联合类型),
  超时即快速 reject → 流入已有的 wire 重试 / rollback 路径,batch 立即继续、不再冻 18s、不留迟到孤儿。
  连接器 107 单测全过。**注意:平台偶发假死本身仍在,本修复是把「无限挂死」降级为「快速干净失败可重试」。**

## [0.23.0] - 2026-08-10

插拔类器件特性版(用户在车机真板复测中逐条点名):打分骂什么、规划器就修什么,
两边口径锁死不分家。全部真机验证(车机 J2 Type-C 从缩板内 129mil → 齐边 →
外突 40.7mil,板 74.0→75.4 [good] 0 blocking)。

### Added
- **`pcb layout-score --part J2,U1` —— 器件聚焦视角**。整体归因是「维→器件」,
  用户真实工作流是反向的(整体打分 → 点名要优化的器件):聚焦卡汇总该件的直接
  扣分、**关联提及**(TVS 离 J2 太远,扣的是 TVS 的分但提及 J2 —— 动哪个由人定)、
  blocking、几何现状(坐标/装配面/离板边距离)。位号词边界匹配(C1 不误配 C10)。
  顺带修掉 `--all` 的数据层谎言:routable 在 scorer 内截前 12,现在 `--all`/
  `--part` 时各维保留全量归因。
- **插接面贴边规则(plug-face-not-flush,edge-io 维)**。Type-C/USB/SD/耳机口
  (PJ-3xx/3.5mm)类**水平插拔件**的器件特性:插头从板外水平进入,插接面必须与
  板边齐平甚至**外突**(off-board 判据用焊盘不用 bbox,正是为了放行外突)。
  此前 300mil 边带内一律算"在边"——车机 J2 缩板内 129mil 读成无异常,实际
  插不了。缩进按深度线性扣(≤25mil 容差齐平,外突负 gap 合法)。
- **插拔通道禁布(connector-mating-blocked)**。内部卧贴插口(FPC/内部 Type-C/
  卡座)开口**前方** 250mil×口宽的通道里不许压器件 —— 压了插头进不来。开口
  方向只认块库 openings 声明(判不了绝不猜);贴边件通道在板外天然免检。
  check 规则(WARN)+ edge-io 扣分(归因落**遮挡件**,每件 10 封顶 30)+
  规划器 T2 落位后把通道登记为占用区(卫星永不被规划进通道)。

### Fixed
- **T2 贴边对插拔类器件边距=0 齐平**。规划器原统一留 45mil 边距、且
  「edgeMargin+30 内算就位」—— 插拔件永远差一截还不被挪(车机 J2 缩板内的
  规划侧根因)。插拔类(与 plug-face 规则同一正则)贴边边距=0,就位判据同步收紧。

## [0.22.0] - 2026-08-10

PCB 布局能力重构版(#167/#168/#153):多维打分 → 精修 → 确认门的闭环 + 规划器
合法化 + 五块嘉立创开源真板校准。

### Added
- **`pcb layout-score` —— 布局质量九维打分(#167 DETECT 层)**。partition/flow-order/
  edge-io/protection/tidy/compact/rf/routable/clearance 九维各 0-100 + 逐器件归因
  (penalty=「先动谁」),硬错(短路/重叠/出板框)单列 blocking 一票否决不进加权。
  三条硬约定:skipped=「没测」≠满分;verdict 单一产出点(计数与判定绝不分家);
  归因恒等式 Σpenalty=100−该维分。`--spec` 解锁 flow-order 与 internal 连接器判定;
  `--from <dump>` 离线复现;默认只有 blocking 非零退出(`--min-score` 显式给才当门)。
- **`pcb refine` —— 打分驱动的精修环(#167 ACHIEVE 层,#153 护栏)**。读逐维归因对
  最弱维下确定性变换,每步复核:check finding 上升/分数下降/check 读不到都回滚该步
  (逐步回滚,回读证实才算 restored)。默认 dry-run;不可动集合(锁定件+已签字
  tier1/2)、位移预算超限剔除不截断。blocking 不归它管 —— 开跑即报 ⛔ 指路。
- **`pcb floorplan` / `easyeda spec validate·show` —— S0 spec 类型化(#167 KNOWLEDGE
  层)**。flow/flowAxis/modules[].kind/interfaces[].{edge,facing,internal,plugWidthMm}
  受控词表校验,拼错枚举从静默失灵变 ERROR;floorplan 按 flow 切有序带(只读)。
- **place-constrained 合法化阶段**:规划完用 layout-score/lint 同一纯核对虚拟落子
  复算 blocking,新引入的重叠/短路/出板框就地螺旋重定位、无解弃子(保原位),弃伙伴
  连带弃跟随者(FollowsID 血缘)。落点统一吸 5mil 锚点格。**车机真板 benchmark:
  规划器首次全面反超人类基线(综合 53.8→64.3,阻塞 1→0,protection +16.9)**。
- **保护件归因对齐**:跟随伙伴=打分器同规则选出的端口件(isProtectionIdent/
  isPortIdent 共享);伙伴没动就不跟;落点按「离伙伴焊盘更近」双候选择优。
- **#168 两条连接器规则**:internal-on-edge / connector-plug-clearance 进 `pcb check`
  (+插头护套包络表 `_plug_envelope.json`),与 edge-io 维共用判定;位号优先于器件名
  (USBLC6/SMAJ 不再被误判成连接器)。
- **`workflow status` 消费质量快照**:confirm-layout 落的多维快照渲染 + `--reconcile`
  逐维退化对比(掉 ≥5 分标 ⚠;scored→skipped 报「失去可测性」绝不当 0 分)。
- **金标准校准体系(#167 LEARNING 层)**:`make layout-calibrate` 正负对照 fixture +
  **五块开源真板入库**(实战派ESP32-S3 [maxBlocking=0 旗舰锚点]/庐山派K230/
  RK3568四层/MIPI扩展板/BBClaw),好板不掉分+blocking 不误报回归机械可查。
- **`pcb.outline.get` 返回板框真多边形 `points` + `outlineFormat`(#167,连接器侧)**。
  异形板「到板边距离」不再按 AABB 错算;`points`=折线中心线(铣刀路径=真板边),
  bbox 是渲染范围含线宽。多条/含弧退化 bbox 并自述原因(消费方自动回落标 degraded)。

### Fixed
- **五板校准修掉的六处度量失真**:渲染 bbox 当 courtyard(实战派S3 曾被误报 104 条
  overlap → 重叠/间距改**焊盘并集**本体代理);圆盘按矩形算(角上假铜误报短路 →
  圆-圆/圆-矩真实几何);clearance 阈值拿错规则(4mm 板框类值当装配间距 → >20mil
  退回 7.87mil 规范下限)+ 密度归一渐近曲线(好板 86-95,负对照仍必响);同网集堆叠
  豁免(装配选项/并联不可能跨网短路);连接器壳下垫件豁免(焊盘不接触只有并集相交);
  板框内切割误当外边界护栏(MIPI utilization 曾 1679%)。blocking 误报 267→11,
  好板综合分聚拢 59.9~67.7,BBClaw 哨兵全程无误杀。
- **refine 环 check 读失败保守回滚**:countGateableFindings 返 -1 时旧护栏恒放行,
  现按「无法复核=回滚」处理;refine 环本体补 8 个假 daemon E2E(dry-run/apply/
  回滚/回读漂移/tier 保护/中途失败)。

## [0.21.7] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **`sch note` —— 电路说明文本(纯 CLI,zone-draw 同款内部 exec_js 惯例)**。
  用户反馈:agent 产出的原理图常一页塞满、无分区框、无文字说明,电气对但交付
  可读性差。Skill 布局默认升级为「分页分区+电路说明」三件套:S1 分页(每页一个
  功能域)、S2 分区框+区名(`sch zones set`→`zone-draw`)、S3 **每模块 1~3 行电路
  说明**(`sch note --text "LDO: 5V→3V3 1A\n输入/输出各 100nF" --x … --y …`,
  `\n` 换行,字号默认 10/灰色低于区名标签)。创建后回读 primitiveId 验证 + 显式
  save;`sch text-list` 枚举、`sch prim-delete` 清理。真机验证(ceshi):多行内容
  完整落盘读回。约束落点:SKILL.md 档位默认表+停点② · design-flow S3 过门条件 ·
  schematic-layout-conventions §1.5(含合格说明正反例)。

### Fixed
- **`attrs_backfill` 灌库占位 `Designator` 键灭掉全板位号 —— 根因修复(此前误诊为平台行为)**。
  一块 166 器件的板 `pcb import-changes` 后位号 166/166 全变占位符(`U?`/`C?`/`RF?`),
  最初归因于平台导入——**错**。真机控制变量二分(ceshi 六件小板)钉死真凶:裸
  `eda.pcb_Document.importChanges()` + 手动点「应用修改」位号全对(平台无辜,还顺带
  给两侧铸造 `uniqueId`);毁位号的是我们自己的 `pcb.component.attrs_backfill`
  (import-changes 自动跑):**器件库记录的 otherProperty 自带 `Designator: "C?"`
  (库自己的占位位号),merge「填空值」把它灌进实例,平台把 otherProperty.Designator
  同步成图元位号** —— 安静板上单独跑一次 sync-attrs 即 100% 复现,与时序无关,每件
  变成各自库记录的占位前缀。修法三件套:merge **剔除平台投影键**(`Designator` /
  `Unique ID` / `Name` / `Add into BOM` / `Manufacturer*` / `Supplier*` —— 它们存在
  顶层图元状态里,写进 otherProperty 要么被同步成状态(毁位号)要么被静默丢弃(报告
  年年撒谎「6/6 backfilled」且永不幂等));同一 modify **显式回传当前位号**兜底;
  **清洗**老版本已漏进实例的占位 Designator 键。修后实测:全流程 E2E 位号全真、
  sync-attrs 幂等(第二轮 0/6)、真实属性照常回填(Value/Tolerance/Voltage Rating)。
- **`pcb.components.list` 补 `uniqueId` + CLI `pcb sync-designators` 存量修复**。
  位号是这套工具链几乎所有规则的输入 —— S0 spec 模块归属、保护件前缀(F*/D*/TVS*)、
  去耦判定、`pcb check` 定位、BOM,位号一丢它们不是失灵,而是静默按错误分类算出一份
  看着正常的报告。被旧版毁过的板用 `easyeda pcb sync-designators` 修:按 `uniqueId`
  (`gge*`,平台首次 sch→PCB 导入时铸造、**跨文档同一命名空间**,实测 166/166 匹配;
  primitiveId 每个文档各 mint 一套对不上)从原理图回填,**只动占位符位号**(PCB 手工
  设过的真实位号绝不覆盖),每笔写入回读验证(平台 modify 有静默 no-op 前科),修完
  立落 `pcb.save` 检查点;`import-changes` 之后自动殿后跑(排在 attrs 同步**之后**,
  任何整包 otherProperty 写入若再毁位号都能当场修回),`--no-sync-designators` 可关。
  原理图侧位号也是占位符的件单独归类提示「先标注原理图」,不再误报成 unmatched。
- **`tagComponentPages` 页级隔离 + 前台必恢复**。此前中途任一页 `openDocument` 失败
  会整体 abort 且跳过前台恢复 —— 前台留在随机原理图页,随后的 PCB 批量写全落错前台。
  现在单页失败只跳过该页,`finally` 无条件恢复调用前的前台文档。
- **`pcb.import_changes` 后续同步只在 `confirm=applied` 时执行**(CLI 侧)。#124 语义:
  importChanges 的 promise 会在「确认导入信息」弹框**刚打开**时就 resolve true ——
  `imported=true` 不等于器件已落地。此前 CLI 拿它当门,弹框未确认时照跑同步、读到
  导入前的板面、静默空跑;现在未确认落地会明确警告并指引手动补跑。

### Added
- **`schematic.export.image` —— 选区/整页导出 SVG·PNG·PDF(#166)**。
  `easyeda sch export-image --ids '[...]' --out block.svg` 把**指定图元**单独渲染出来
  (自动选中并把画布裁到选区:实测 3 个器件 → 283×155,整页 1191×846),省略 `--ids`
  导整页;`--format svg|png|pdf`、`--scope selection|page|project`、`--page`、`--out`。
  **这是 agent「看局部原理图」的可靠通路** —— 老路子 `view region` + `snapshot --no-fit`
  依赖视口重绘,**标签页不在前台时 rAF 不触发、画布不重画,于是静默截回上一帧整页**
  (#166 报的「仍截整页」真因在此,不是 #20 回归);新命令不走视口、不需前台、不弹框,
  SVG 还是矢量。
  ⚠️ **底层 `getExportDocumentFile` 的 `object` 字面量,官方类型定义三个值全是错的**
  (`'All Schematic'`/`'Current Schematic'`/`'Current Schematic Page'`),真值是
  `'Current Page'`/`'Current Page Selected Items'`/`'Project'`(读 `sch-main.js` 源码实证)。
  传错**不报错**:内部 `Z.pureSchematics[<非法key>].sort` 抛 TypeError、空 reject 无人接,
  **外层 promise 既不 resolve 也不 reject**,编辑器卡在 1% 进度条(实测两次卡死)。
  handler 固化真值并加 30s 超时兜底,绝不再让动作队列被悬着的 promise 占死。

## [0.21.4] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **(CLI/daemon) `go test` 不再把 fixture 写进用户真实审计日志(#159)**:
  `newAuditWriter("")` 兜底到 `~/.easyeda-agent/audit`,而 daemon 测试里的
  `New(Options{})` 都不设 `AuditDir` —— 每个走 `handleAction` 的测试都往生产日志
  追加假窗口 `w1`/`w2`、假工程 `motobox`(已污染 33 条,巡检时被当成真实的连日
  `schematic.components.list` 失败)。新增 `EASYEDA_AUDIT_DIR` 覆写(与
  `EASYEDA_WORKFLOW_DIR` 同款约定,**读写两侧同源** —— `audit tail`/`audit export`
  与 skill 的 `audit-baseline.py` 都认),并在 `testing.Testing()` 下**禁用**默认
  兜底路径:忘了传 `AuditDir` 的新测试再也污染不到用户日志(结构性防漏,不靠纪律)。
- **(CLI) `waitDocSettle` 对 PCB 文档不再空转 8s(#161)**:settle 探针写死
  `schematic.components.list`,`--page` 指向 PCB 时探针必然失败,而失败被吞成
  「继续轮询」→ 审计日志 **21 连发** `EDA_CALL_FAILED`、`ready` 恒 false。现在
  探针按文档类型选(`pcb` → `pcb.components.list`),守卫**下沉到探针本身**而不是
  指望每个调用方记得判断(`doc switch` 有守卫、`switchToPage` 没有,漏一个就复现);
  连续 3 次探针失败即止损。实测 21 连发 → 0,8s → 3.4s。
- **(CLI) `sch zone-draw` 框贴图纸边缘并压标题栏 keep-out(#163)**:zones 模式在
  **原始 sheet bbox** 上分格且只内缩 4 单位,底排落在标题栏 x 范围内的格直接压进
  明细表 —— zone-draw 画的框会触发我们自己的 `titleblock-overlap` 规则,而 keep-out
  几何一直是现成的(`deriveSheetGeometry`,partition 模式和 `sch check` 都在用),
  zones 模式只是没消费它。现在先按 margin(默认 20)内缩出可用区**再分格**,并把与
  keep-out 相交的框底边抬到上沿 + 8;标签移入框内不再压框线;收缩后过短的格跳过
  不画残条。真机(A4 1170×825 / keepout [468,0→1170,165]):整体由 `x[4..1166]
  y[4..821]` 收到 `x[24..1146] y[24..801]`,底排底边 4 → 173,`titleblockOverlaps: 0`。
- **`errorDetail` 不再被折叠成 `[object Object]`(#160)**:`edaError` 用
  `String(err)` 渲染抛出物,平台抛**裸对象**时根因整条丢失(实测 `debug.exec_js`
  两条只剩「有个对象」)。而 `errorDetail` 存在的**唯一理由**就是承载 `eda.*` 的
  原始抛出物(titleblock.modify 0/32 那次复盘只能靠 payload 反推)。新增纯函数
  `describeThrown`:Error→message(空则 name)、对象→`[code] message | {json}`
  (可读部分在前,截断也留得住)、循环引用标 `[Circular]`、无可枚举属性直说
  ——替换 `actions.ts` 9 处 + `transport.ts` 1 处同款三元(共享出口覆盖 140 个
  `edaError` 调用点)。离线单测 10 条。
- **原理图图元删除改走 `sch_PrimitiveObject`,文本删除终于真落盘(#164)**:
  `sch_PrimitiveText.delete()` **只从内存/渲染索引摘除,从不进持久化模型** ——
  删完 getAll 说没了、`save` 也说没了,`doc reload` 后**原 id 全部复活**。于是
  zone-draw 的「删旧+重画」实为只加不减(车机V2 P5 累积到 56 个标签)。真机定因:
  同一次 save 里新建的文本**落盘了**、删掉的文本**回来了** —— 不是没标脏,是
  delete 压根没进模型。两处订正原 issue:**矩形/导线的 per-class delete 其实是
  落盘的**(只有文本坏);**文本的 `modify` 同样被丢弃**(改内容 reload 后回退),
  等于文本一经创建就冻结。修法=页面图元统一走**通用图元类**
  `eda.sch_PrimitiveObject.delete(ids)`,它跨类型且真持久化(混批 6 文本+1 矩形
  +1 导线,reload 后全零,连历史遗留的孤儿标签一并清掉);旧平台无此类时回退
  per-class。`sch zone-draw --clear` 与创建失败回滚路径同步改走通用类。
- **`schematic.primitives.delete` 改为回读验证计数(#164)**:此前
  `deleted[key] = ids.length` **直接来自请求数**,从不回读 —— 与 `page.clear`
  修过的「把枚举数当删除数报」是同一个坑,只是没修到这里。现在删完重新枚举:
  `deleted`/`total` 只计真正消失的,有幸存则按 #151 约定返回 `partial:true` +
  `survived` + warning(画布已变不抛错),CLI 侧 `sch prim-delete` 随之非零退出。
  **同时记一条判据教训**:立即回读**证明不了持久化** —— 文本删除的立即回读一直
  是"已删",`zone-draw --clear` 那套 fail-closed 校验因此报了一路"cleared 6"、
  实则 3 个标签全在。凡涉及删除是否落盘,唯一可信判据是 **`doc reload` 后复查**。
- **跨页 `primitiveId` 不再被误报「不存在」(#162)**:`getComponentOrThrow` 只调
  活动页作用域的 `get()`,查不到就抛 `No schematic component found` —— 但
  `delete` 走全页 `getAll`,**同一个 id 同一个窗口**,`replace` 说找不到、17 秒后
  `delete` 却删得掉(审计实证:切页后同 id 即成功)。现在 miss 走一次全页判定:
  在别页 → 报出**它到底在哪页**并给 `easyeda doc switch <page>` 指引;确实不存在
  → 文案明确为「on any page」。收敛 modify / rebind / replace 5 个调用点。
- **`pcb check` silk-over-pad 误报根修(#155)**:真机裁决 —— `pcb silk-align` 的
  落点**一直是对的**(报告中心 = 实测渲染 bbox 中心,分毫不差),issue 观测的
  「实际落点偏左下半文本」是把**存储的左下角锚点**误读成落点。真凶在 check 侧:
  silk-over-pad 把 silk.list 的 x/y(左下角锚点)**当文本中心**用,判定框整体偏移
  半个文本 → 对 silk-align 验证过干净的位置误报压焊盘(「换个焊盘继续压」= 判定框
  恒在真实文本左下方)。修:`pcb.silk.list` 每条文本附**真实渲染 bbox**
  (getPrimitivesBBox),check 直接矩形相交 —— 锚点/字宽/旋转全不用猜;旧连接器
  回退近似也改为从锚点正确起箱。真机双向验收:silk-align 摆好 → check 0;故意压
  焊盘 → check 1。

### Added
- **`schematic.component.resolve_lcsc`(#158)—— 确定性「已放置器件→真 C 号」批量解析**。
  精确匹配链(实例 C 号 → MPN 严格相等 → 工程库名),匹配的**封装必须与实例一致**
  (唯一命中但封装不同 = 封装变体不符,照样 unresolved)——绝不模糊兜底
  (真机事故:裸 search("U.FL-R-SMT-1(01)") 的 r[0] 是 C1017 磁珠)。默认 dry-run;
  `apply` 把 C 号写回 supplierId 非 C 号形状的实例(整板修复一条命令,166 件场景
  免手工)。unresolved 附候选;同 MPN+封装缓存。replace/rebind 的身份解析同步加固
  (唯一命中也强制封装一致)。CLI `easyeda sch resolve-lcsc [--apply] [--page]`。
  真机验:坏 supplierId 件 via=mpn 解析+写回,已带真 C 号件 via=instance 不重写。

## [0.21.2] - 2026-08-05

### Changed
- **显示名改为 EDA Agent Connector 后重传立创市场(包名与 uuid 均不变)**。
  按市场管理规范,`displayName` 去除 "easyeda" 字样;经与市场管理员确认,内部
  包名 `easyeda-agent-connector` 与 uuid **无需改动**,原条目撤销已解除,同一
  条目重新上传即可——已装用户的原地自动更新不受影响,无需任何操作。
  README(中/英)/包内 README/install.sh 均已附更名说明。

## [0.21.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **`schematic.read` 的 components 输出漏了 `primitiveId`(真机事故,motobox)**:
  read 只输出 `uniqueId`(`gge…`,sch↔PCB 关联键),agent 抓它当改动句柄喂给
  select / delete / modify → 全部 notFound/空选择,看似「任何器件都改不动」。
  现在每条 components 带 **`primitiveId`(16 位 hex,select/modify/delete/replace/
  rebind 的唯一合法句柄)**,uniqueId 注释明确标注「非 primitiveId」。
  真机验:place 返回的 id 与 read 输出一致,按它删除成功。

## [0.21.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **`schematic.component.replace` 已随 0.20.0 发布;本版补齐它牵出的整条「器件标准化」链路**(见下)。
- **`pcb.component.attrs_backfill` / `easyeda pcb sync-attrs` —— PCB 器件属性回填**:
  平台 sch→PCB 导入只搬顶层身份字段,otherProperty **键在值空**(Value/耐压/精度/
  Datasheet/… 全 ""),PCB 侧器件标准化面板整列空白;且**原理图实例的属性值
  save/reload 后同样为空**(真机实证:place 后即读有值,重开后为空)——原理图不可作
  同步源。唯一稳定载体是 **device 库记录**:按实例 C 号(#157 回填保证是真 C 号)
  `getByLcscIds` 批量解析,只填 PCB 侧空值键(手改值优先,`--overwrite` 强制),
  全程 PCB 前台零切页。`pcb import-changes` 成功后自动跑(`--no-sync-attrs` 关)。
  真机验:import 后 PCB 件 Value/耐压/精度/Datasheet 等 9+ 字段从空到齐。
- **`schematic.text.list`(#156)—— 只读枚举激活页全部文本图元**(id/content/x/y/
  rotation/fontSize/color),配 `sch prim-delete --ids` 清理孤儿 zone-draw 标签,
  不再需要 `debug.exec_js` 逃生舱。页懒加载定律适用(只见激活页);CLI
  `easyeda sch text-list [--page <p>]`。真机验:建孤儿标签 → text-list 枚举 →
  prim-delete 清零。

### Fixed
- **放置器件 supplierId 默认成 subPartName(`<MPN>.1`)而非真 C 号(#157)**。
  平台 `sch_PrimitiveComponent.create` 的原生行为,导致官方「器件标准化」面板全板
  标红、BOM Supplier Part 不可下单。现在 place / replace / rebind 重放置后自动从
  device 库记录回填**真立创 C 号**(`^C\d+$` 才写;device 无 C 号的外采占位件不动;
  回填失败降级 warning 不阻断)。place 结果新增 `supplierIdBackfilled` 字段。
  真机验:place C1525 → 实例 supplierId=C1525(此前=CL05B104KO5NNNC.1)。
- **rebind(换封装/换符号)对系统库器件从未工作过,现已修复**。三层根因真机逐一定位:
  ① 绑定链用的 `getState_Component().uuid` 是 16 位符号实例 id,`lib_Device.modify/create`
  一律拒收 → 复用 replace 的 `resolvePlacedDeviceIdentity`(C 号→MPN→工程库名)解析真
  32 位身份;② **系统库 device 记录平台层面只读**(32 位 uuid 也 modify=false)→ 新增
  **个人库克隆回退**:复制/复用同名副本 → 副本绑新封装/符号 → 重放置,结果
  `mode='cloned-to-personal-library'` + `clonedDevice`,回滚删副本;③ 克隆的 copy 与
  modify 都会弹「符号/封装另存为」冲突框且 **promise 挂死到有人点击**(#124 家族),
  而后台 tab 的 setTimeout 轮询被 Chrome 节流到 ~1次/分 → 改用 **MutationObserver
  自动点「确认」**(默认选项「使用已有的库」即所需语义),护航整个克隆段。
  全链 sys_Log 埋点(`[rebind]`)可回读诊断;CLI rebind/replace 超时提至 90s
  (串行库链在线搜索+克隆最坏情况超默认 20s)。ceshi 真机:系统库电容
  C0603→C0805 换封装 4.1s 完成,位号保留,弹框自动确认(dialog clicks: 1)。

## [0.20.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **`schematic.component.replace` —— 整器件替换(换型号)**,官方「器件标准化」面板
  「使用推荐器件」的 API 等价物(该面板仅暴露打开面板的枚举,零数据/操作 API)。
  官方无 rebind-device 原语,走 delete → 同位姿 create → 恢复位号 + uniqueId
  (保 uniqueId 使 sch→PCB import-changes 走 UPDATE);器件身份字段(name/制造商/
  供应商/LCSC)**不带过去**,跟新 device 走,`keepProperties` 才连带旧自定义属性。
  目标三选一:`lcsc`(须唯一)/ `deviceUuid+deviceLibraryUuid` / `query`(须唯一命中);
  delete 后失败回滚重建原器件(含完整身份)。返回 **pinDiff**(同位姿按 pinNumber 对比
  removed/added/moved)——非空即旧导线对不上,须重接线并 `sch drc`/`sch check`。
  CLI:`easyeda sch replace --id <pid> --lcsc C14663`。真机验证(ceshi,双向
  C14663↔C1525 + same-device 拒绝)并顺带修复两坑:回滚身份不再信 16 位的
  `getState_Component().uuid`(`resolvePlacedDeviceIdentity` 走 C 号→MPN+封装名解析
  32 位真身份,解析不出动画布前 abort);响应改用 modify 返回的图元序列化
  (create 对象立即回读是恢复前的陈旧值)。

### Fixed
- **manifest 全面去 "easyeda" 字样 —— 治市场下架**(管理员原话:「发布者信息和扩展名称
  请移除easyeda」)。`publisher` `easyeda-agent`→`zhoushoujian`;`name`
  `easyeda-agent-connector`→`eda-agent-connector`;`displayName` →"EDA Agent Connector";
  description 与编辑器菜单标题同步改写;仅保留 GitHub 仓库 URL(事实链接)。
  **uuid 不变**,已装用户仍走原地更新;v0.19.0 GitHub Release `.eext` 资产已替换为修正版
  (回验:包内除 URL 外 0 处 easyeda 字样)。打包产物文件名随 name 变为
  `eda-agent-connector_v*.eext`(Release 资产名保持 `easyeda-agent-connector.eext`
  不变,install.sh 依赖它)。


## [0.19.0] - 2026-08-04

> 🙏 感谢 [@NeoSpecies](https://github.com/NeoSpecies) 的 [PR #154](https://github.com/zhuangzard/pcbpilot/pull/154)
> —— 首个外部贡献:定位并修复了「同窗口重复激活互踢 socket」的重连风暴,并带来了 MCP stdio 适配层。
> 本版连接侧的三层修复(activation-scoped id / 失败轮换 / 端口记忆)正是在这个 PR 的基础上叠加完成的。

### Added
- **`pcb silk-zone-outline` —— 按模块在丝印层画区域轮廓 + 区名标注**:读模块内器件的
  真实渲染矩形生成正交阶梯包络,避让穿越轮廓的外部器件,自动选不压器件的位置放区名标签。
- **`sch gate` —— S5 校验门收成一条固定流水线**:`layout-lint → check → bridge-check → drc`
  按固定顺序跑完出一张报告,verdict 三态(`pass`/`fail`/**`blocked`**——检查器没跑成 ≠ 板子有
  问题,报告直接指向 health/doc 修复而不是让 agent 改电路);每个失败 stage 按**实际失败原因**
  带规定的下一步(`blockingReasons`),check 的阻塞项直接给规则类型直方图;`--json` 是四个
  单命令 JSON 的超集(`stages[].detail`)。四个单命令保留作局部复查,交付门走 gate。
- **daemon 对失效 windowId 自动重定向 + 错误分型**:页面刷新会换 windowId,旧 id 的调用
  此前被误报成 `NO_CONNECTOR`「没有连接器」。现在 daemon 记住退役窗口的稳定身份
  (documentUUID 最强判据/project 兜底),自动路由到接替窗口并在 warnings 里告知新 id;
  无法重定向时报 **`STALE_WINDOW`**(明说连接器是好的,列出在线窗口,建议 `--project`)
  或 **`AMBIGUOUS_WINDOW`**(列候选),`NO_CONNECTOR` 只留给真没连接的情况。
- **`scripts/audit-baseline.py` —— 暴露面健康度离线体检**:读 audit log 出「调用分布+失败率 /
  错路回退 / 逐日多样性」三张表;首测揪出 `titleblock.modify` 32 次调用 0 次成功。
- **新增本地 stdio MCP 适配层**(来自 PR #154,@NeoSpecies):`mcp/` 将现有 `easyeda` CLI/daemon 的连接健康、action
  发现、7 个安全 action domain、电路块和 guarded workflow 暴露为 `easyeda_*` tools。
  MCP 不直连 EasyEDA、不绕过 typed action/审计/workflow gate,并明确不暴露任意
  JavaScript 的 `debug.exec_js`;mutation 仍要求同时提供 project 与 doc。

### Fixed
- **修复 EasyEDA Pro 3.2.175 重复激活同一扩展时的永久重连风暴**(来自 PR #154,@NeoSpecies):旧连接器的所有激活
  实例共用固定 host WebSocket id,会互相 close/register 同一 socket,表现为交错 heartbeat、
  windowId 持续变化、`AMBIGUOUS_PROJECT` 和 action response 丢失。现在每次激活生成独立
  socket id;daemon 仅在 project/document/type/tab 四项完整且完全相同时把连接视为 transport
  duplicate,并路由到最新连接。真实不同 tab 或身份不完整仍保持 ambiguous,不会静默误路由。
- **连接器卡死后能自己爬回来:扫描连续失败会轮换 websocket id**(叠加在同版
  activation-scoped id 之上)。`eda.sys_WebSocket.register()` 在同 id 连接仍被 EasyEDA 视为
  "active" 时会**静默忽略新的 url/callback**(pro-api-types `index.d.ts:21025`)。
  activation-scoped id 解决的是「同窗口多激活互踢」,解决不了「**本激活自己的 id 被判为
  active 后 register 全被忽略**」——连续 `WS_ID_ROTATE_AFTER_FAILED_SCANS`(2)轮全端口
  扫描失败后换成 `<base>-r<n>`,全新 id 在 EasyEDA 侧没有记录,register 必然生效。
  happy path(daemon 在线、首轮即连上)始终用基础 id 不受影响;daemon 真不在时轮换也无副作用。
  **真机 soak 实测(2026-08-04,web 编辑器;停 daemon 后不关 tab、不 reload,看能否自愈)**:

  | 版本 | 停 45s | 停 60s | 停 75s |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 仅 activation-scoped | ✅ 5s | ❌ 210s 未自愈 | — |
  | + 轮换 | ✅ 5s | ✅ 5s | ❌ 120s 未自愈 / 同条件重测 ✅ 90s |

  **两者都只是改善概率,都没根治** —— 真实形态不是「永不恢复」而是「**恢复耗时不可预测**」
  (5s / 90s / 210s+)。根因待查,而排查被下面这条可观测性缺陷挡住。
- **连接器诊断日志此前在最需要时不可见,现改走 `eda.sys_Log`**:`diag()` 原本只经
  WebSocket 发给 daemon —— **断线时恰好发不出去**,而断线正是唯一需要它的时刻;这正是
  重连 bug 长期只能黑盒试的结构性原因。排查中实证了两件事(EasyEDA Pro 3.2.175):
  ① **扩展里的 `console.*` 是死代码** —— 沙箱发给扩展的 `console` 每个方法都literally
  是 `()=>{}`(经 `_EXTAPI_SCRIPT_SPACES_[uuid].console.log.toString()` 验证),所以先前
  想补的 console 输出一行也到不了 DevTools;② 沙箱把 `window`/`document`/`localStorage`/
  `indexedDB`/`postMessage` 一律置为 `undefined`,**`eda.*` 是唯一的对外通道**。
  因此主 sink 改为 `eda.sys_Log.add()`:断线时照写、用户在编辑器「日志」面板直接可见、
  且 `eda.sys_Log.sort()` 可编程读回 —— 这才让离线 soak 变得可诊断。WebSocket 发送保留
  为在线路径。同时在每轮扫描起手打 `scan start session/retryCount/wsId`。
  **首次拿到断线期日志即暴露真问题**:一轮全端口扫描要 **18 秒**(每个端口都死等满
  `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=1500`,说明 `register()` 对连不上的端口**不回调失败**、只能靠
  超时兜底),叠加 `retryCount>5` 后的 10s 慢重试 → 一个周期 ~28s。这就是「恢复耗时
  不可预测」的直接来源,也是下一步要收的口子。

- **重连不再每次都全端口重扫:优先重试上次成功的端口**(`scanOrder`)。断线期日志显示
  一轮全扫要 ~18s,因为 `eda.sys_WebSocket.register()` **从不报告"连接被拒"**,每个空端口
  都得烧满 `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`。而重启的 daemon 实际上总是重新绑到同一个端口
  (它按序取范围内第一个空闲端口),所以先试上次成功的端口能把常见重连从「整轮扫描」
  变成「一次尝试」。4 个单测钉住顺序、去重、越界历史值与全覆盖。
  ⚠️ **同期试过把 `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` 1500→600 加速全扫,实测是负优化并已回退**:
  soak 从 `45s✅/60s✅/75s❌` 退到 `45s✅/60s❌/75s❌`,有一轮扫到 `session=58` 仍未重连。
  更快的扫描 = 单位时间内 close()/register() 循环翻倍,而 `REGISTER_DELAY_MS` 那 200ms
  的 id 释放窗口本就紧张 —— **瓶颈是 EasyEDA 那张共享 socket 表的状态机,不是延迟**,
  加速只会喂大它输掉的那场竞争。理由已写进常量注释,免得下次有人再"优化"一遍。

- **`sch gate` 真机验出的三个报告缺陷已修**:strict 档下 summary 缺判据字段导致「全 0 却
  FAIL」自相矛盾;blocker 从 error 计数拼出「0 个阻塞项」却判失败;建议按 stage 名给,
  0 bridge 却教「拆真短路」。现在 status/blocker 均由具名 `blockingReasons` 决定,建议按
  失败原因关键词匹配,绝不把 agent 指向板子没有的问题。
- **`schematic.titleblock.modify` 从「32 次调用 0 次成功」修到有回读验证** —— 这条是
  audit log 离线体检(`scripts/audit-baseline.py`)抓出来的:该 action 历史上被调用 32 次,
  **成功 0 次**,却一直挂在 skill 文档里。根因不在我们的调用姿势,而在旧实现**直接透传平台的
  `ok`**:官方 @beta remarks 原文写着「任何无法识别的明细项将被忽略」且「如若存在无法识别的
  明细项但程序并未出错,将返回 `true` 的结果」——**这个 API 对写不进去的字段报成功**,与
  「删除 API 撒谎」同族。于是「改了个根本不存在的明细项」会被报成功,而真正抛错的那 20 次
  (payload 是拿 `Size`/`Width`/`Height`/`Page Size` 当纸张属性写)既无法证伪也说不出原因。
  现在走 #151 的三态契约:**改前快照 → 写 → 回读逐项比对**,产出 `applied` / `alreadySet` /
  `notApplied` / `unknownKeys`。全部落空 ⇒ ERROR(附「先跑 titleblock-get 看可用 key」的指路);
  部分落空 ⇒ `partial:true` + warnings + CLI 非零退出(已写进画布的子集是既成事实,`ok:true`
  让 autosave 照常落盘);回读不可用 ⇒ `verified:false` 而**绝不**降级成 `ok:false`。
  `alreadySet`(改前就等于期望值)不计入 `applied`、**也不豁免全失败硬门**。
  `unknownKeys` 是本 action 特有的诊断:那些根本不是明细项,**修法是换 key 而不是重试**——
  明细表改不了纸张尺寸。SDK 显式返回 `false` 也不再被吞。9 个单测覆盖上述每一条。
- **audit log 记录 `errorDetail`** —— 协议 `Error.Detail`(连接器捕获的平台原始报错)此前
  被丢弃,日志里只剩我们自己的包装文案(如 "Failed to modify schematic page title block."),
  事后定位根因无从谈起:上面那条 titleblock 的调查只能从 payload 反推。现在原始错误一并落盘。
## [0.18.3] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- **`pcb layout-lint` 新增跨网短路检测(`short` ERROR)—— 从「靠太近」升级到「这两网短路」**:
  两器件 bbox 相交时进一步比**焊盘铜皮矩形**,若两块铜在**共享层**上真的压在一起且**分属不同
  网络**,报 `ERROR short  C2.1[VBAT_RAW] ↔ D2.2[SW1_NODE]` —— 与 KiCad 的 `shorting_items`
  对齐(此前同一份数据上 KiCad 定性成短路,我们只报几何重叠)。short 与 overlap 同级致命
  (`ok=false`、score 归零、verdict `short`、`--gate` 直接失败)。**短路按焊盘层判而不是装配面**:
  两个异面 SMD 焊盘永不短路,但**通孔焊盘(层 12=multi)贯穿所有层**,能跟对面焊盘真短 ——
  这是唯一不吃「同面才比」规则的地方。焊盘取不到尺寸(多边形焊盘)或无网络时**跳过而不猜**。
  与下面的层感知一样**没有用到新 API**,现有 `pcb.components.list --include-pads` 的数据就够算。

### Fixed
- **`pcb layout-lint` 的 overlap 判定不再「层盲」,双面贴片板上的数字终于可信**:它比的是
  **不分层**的渲染 bbox 两两相交,于是**顶层器件与底层器件落在同一 XY 也被判成 overlap**,
  而那在物理上是完全合法的顶底对穿。真实案例:box-v2 rev-a(166 器件 / 642 焊盘,85×45mm
  四层双面贴片)跑出 **116 条 overlap**,人工按层分组重算的真值是 **0**,该项目 README 只能
  专门写一段警告绕开这个数字。对照实验(本机 KiCad 10.0.1 实跑):两个 `C_0805` 放完全相同的
  XY、一个 F.Cu 一个 B.Cu,`kicad-cli pcb drc` 报 0 violations —— KiCad 比的是**分层**的
  courtyard(`F.CrtYd`/`B.CrtYd`),天生按层分组。现在器件按**装配面**(`pcb.components.list`
  本就返回的 `layer`,1=顶 2=底)分组后才两两比,**overlap / tight spacing / 手焊烙铁通道**
  三项同改(底面邻居堵不住顶面的烙铁);未知面(`layer` 缺失)保守地与两面都比,缺字段永远
  不会**掩盖**真重叠。每条 finding 带 `side`,报告头带 `sides` 分布(如 `[bottom 134 / top 32]`)。
  同板复跑:**overlap 116 → 0、tight 7 → 3**,与人工重算真值一致。
- **安装脚本撞上 GitHub API 限流时不再只丢一句 `Could not determine latest release
  version`**:`install.sh` 解析 latest release 走匿名 `api.github.com`(每 IP 每小时 60 次),
  公司出口 / NAT / CI 很容易撞满并拿到 `403`。现在(1)有 token 就带上 —— 依次取
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN`,都没有则回落到已登录的 `gh auth token`;(2)新增
  `EASYEDA_VERSION=<tag>` 直接锁版本、完全跳过 API 查询(裸 `0.18.2` 会自动补 `v`);
  (3)失败信息可执行 —— 403/429 明确说是限流并给出「设 token / `gh auth login`」与
  「`EASYEDA_VERSION=<tag>`」两条出路,401(token 失效)、404(无 latest release)、
  网络不可达也各有独立提示。README(中/英)与 `docs/quick-start.md` 同步补充。

## [0.18.2] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **安装脚本更新 skill 不再产生 `.bak` 备份、污染 skills 目录**:`install.sh` 的
  `install_skill_to` 从「先 `mv` 成 `easyeda-agent.bak.<时间戳>` 再拷新版本」改为
  **干净替换**——检测到本地 skill 与 release 不一致时直接 `rm -rf` 旧目录再 `cp` 新版本，
  不再在 `~/.claude/skills` / `~/.codex/skills` 下留一堆过期备份副本（备份目录会被 skill
  加载器扫到、误加载旧内容）。需要保留本地改动的用户仍可用 `EASYEDA_SKILL_PRESERVE=1`
  跳过覆盖。
- **多页原理图功能框/标题不再串页或只留内存**:`sch zones` 认领与 fixed/partition/
  autolayout 三条绘框路径统一按 documentUuid 持久化（旧 `schZones`/单 frame 记录仍可读）；
  fixed 模式开放 `--font-size`（默认 14pt）。重画/清除会回读 rectangle/text ID，任何 survivor
  都失败并保留恢复记录；创建数量须 1:1，部分创建自清理；成功画/清均显式校验
  `schematic.save(saved:true)`，避免孤儿文本和跨页误删。

## [0.18.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **电路块库吸收 M5Stack StickS3(K150)—— 11 个新块 + 2 个新类目**:从官方公开原理图
  (V0.6)对标提取,填补库里完全缺失的品类。新增 `audio`(`es8311_codec_i2s` /
  `aw8737_classd_spk` / `mems_mic_analog`)、`display`(`st7789_spi_lcd_btb`)两个 category
  (schema enum + `validate.go` 同步),以及 `esp32s3_pico_native_usb`(🔥 S3-PICO 原生 USB
  下载,无 CH340 桥)、`bmi270_imu_i2c`、`ir_txrx_remote`、`sy7088_boost_5v`、
  `lgs4056_liion_charge_path`、`i2c_isolation_2n7002dw`、`usbc_dual_orientation_data`。
  standard-parts.json 补 25 个新料。**全部经真机验证升 `verified`**:deviceUuid/LCSC
  100% 解析(`lib search`+`by-lcsc`)、`--probe` 刷真实符号脚、`blocks-pin-audit` 0 fanout/
  0 missing、`sch block-apply` 孤立单放 reconciled + `bridge-check` 0/0/0。多层校验抓修一批
  静默错接:`USB_D±`实为模组脚 `GPIO20/19`、BMI270 真符号脚 `SCX/SDX`(图片是 SCx/SDx)、
  mic 供电 R52=100R 非 100K、ESP32-S3-PICO **无 GPIO47/48 脚**(电源脚多名/地=EP)、
  AXE512127D 连接器纯数字 pad、双 MOSFET 库符号为单管(CJ3439 拆两放置)。conventions 侧吸收:
  `pcb-layout-conventions §7.10`(StickS3 第 4 块对标)、`design-decisions`(USB 架构/自动
  下载各加「纯原生 USB 无桥」第三选项)、`docs/board-absorption-sticks3.md`(含 PY32-PMIC
  多域电源架构参考)。

### Fixed
- **autoconnect 改用方向感知的真实 marker 外形，消除“规划通过、落图重叠”**:旧规划器把
  netport/netflag 一律近似成端点居中的 `24×11` 方框，既低估 31-unit 长端口，又虚构端点
  后方占位，导致密集引脚处错判。现在按 netport/ground/power 家族和四个方向使用真机标定
  bbox，打分与批内占位共用同一预测器；StickS3 外设页实测 marker overlap `17→0`，
  45-pin canonical topology 修复前后哈希完全一致。
- **模板布局链路 fail-closed，不再把“散件摊开”误报成已完成**:`components.list` 提供
  页级 connectivity summary 与 pins 证明；模板引擎遇到活动连接或缺失几何即拒绝运行，
  应用过程支持事务回滚、回读与保存校验，并以 strict layout/check 门收尾。本次 StickS3
  外设页按 LCD / IMU / 按键三块重排后，器件、图签、引脚、分区冲突均为 0。
- **`sch block-apply` 位号前缀映射缺 `mosfet`/`sensor`/`mic` 命名空间**:StickS3 吸收引入
  这三类新料后,block-apply 因 `bapPrefixes` 无对应前缀而硬报错拒放(设计上不猜前缀免误配)。
  补 `mosfet→Q` / `sensor→U` / `mic→MK`(IEEE-315 类),受影响的 6 个块(BMI270/IR/音频/
  I2C 隔离/锂电充电/SPI 屏)现可正常孤立单放并验证。
- **`schematic.component.modify` 自定义属性静默 no-op**:CLI 文档使用
  `customAttributes`,但 EasyEDA SDK 实际只接受 `otherProperty`,导致命令返回成功却不更新
  `Value` 等属性。连接器现在将兼容别名转换为 SDK 字段、与现有属性合并后写入,并用新器件
  句柄逐字段回读验证;平台再次静默忽略时会明确报错,不再假报成功。(#150, 感谢 @zhiqiangme 贡献)
- **`schematic.component.modify` 部分应用丢 autosave(#150 的回读门收尾,#151)**:
  回读门从「任何字段未生效即抛错」改为**分级语义** — SDK 部分应用时抛错会让 daemon
  (只对 ok:true 排 autosave)跳过落盘,已写进画布的子集只留内存、重试面对部分变异的
  文档。现在:全部生效=ok;**部分生效=ok + `result.{partial,applied,notApplied,
  propertiesBefore}` + warnings**(已应用子集照常 autosave,`propertiesBefore` 支撑
  重放恢复与审计 before/after,CLI `sch modify` 非零退出保住错误信号);纯属性补丁
  0 字段生效仍报错(画布确未变,回读铁律不倒退)。另:**未知顶层 patch 键前置拒绝**
  (逐字抄自 pro-api-types 的 modify 14 键签名,SDK 对未知键静默丢弃、事后无从归因);
  回读值比较 String() 强转容忍(平台把数字属性规范化为字符串,不再误报 partial);
  modify 成功后**回读通道本身失败**降级为 `verified:false` + warning 而非抛错
  (250ms 重试一次;抛错同样会丢 autosave)。CLI 侧新增连接器 warnings 的 stderr
  choke-point 渲染(对齐 staleRisk/concurrentWriter)。对抗性评审加固:`applied`
  只计**回读可证明**的写入(期望值与原值本就相同的键归 `alreadySet`,不豁免
  全失败硬门——否则「一个已满足键+其余全丢」可绕过假成功检测);**新增键**
  merge 语义下重放 `propertiesBefore` 删不掉,结构化暴露为 `addedKeys` 且文案
  如实说明;partial 警告文案带 primitiveId(CLI 全局按文本 dedup,不同组件不
  互吞);`propertiesBefore` 三条返回路径全带(审计 before/after);playbook
  重放(`easyeda apply`)与 `sch no-connect` 同步接 partial 失败门;
  `schematic.page.rename` 的降级 warning 同步提升到顶层 warnings(吃到 stderr
  渲染,`result.warning` 保留兼容)。

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — `sch check` 三条几何 marker 规则 (issue #146/#147/#148)
- 电气检查(连接器 `schematicCheck`)看不见纯几何缺陷。新增三条 **Go 侧**规则,消费
  `components.list --include-bbox` 已流入的真实 bbox/锚点(零连接器改动、纯离线单测可验收):
  - **`duplicate-net-marker`**(#146):同类型+同网+量化锚点的重合 netflag/netport ≥2 报 WARN,
    finding 带全部 `primitiveIds` + `suggestKeepId`/`suggestDeleteIds`,直接喂 `sch prim-delete`;
    量化容忍 1384.9999 类浮点漂移,跨页/跨网/跨类型不误合并。
  - **`titleblock-overlap`**(#147):part/marker bbox 正面积侵入 A4 图签 keep-out。
  - **`marker-overlap`**(#148):marker×part / marker×marker 正面积相交(part×part 是 layout-lint
    的活),`--overlap-eps` 调噪声下限(默认 0.5),抑制已被 duplicate 规则报过的重合对。
  真机验证:ceshi P1 真实板报出 28 组 marker 重叠(含平行同侧端口 31×1 天然相交)。

### Added — 数据驱动 A4 分区规划器 `sch zone-plan` / `zone-draw --mode partition` (issue #149)
- 固定九宫格 `zoneRect` 表达不了「按整纸切功能区 + 右下图签留缺口」的行业版式。新 planner
  从活体几何求解:usable sheet(减 margin)按**模块 bbox 之间的自然空隙**切列/行分割线
  (edge-gap 而非中心 midpoint——高模块跨过中心线会跑出分区;空隙需 ≥ gutter),每个分区抬到
  图签 keep-out 之上、顶部留 title band 放大字号区名。模块 bbox = `sch zones` 认领各件 live bbox
  并集。`zone-plan --json` 落盘前出方案 + validation 五项(sheetOverflow/partitionOverlap/
  titleBlockHits/moduleOutsideZone/labelCollisions)。partition frame id **按 documentUuid 分页
  持久化**(`SchZoneFrameIdsByPage`,逐页 redraw/clear 不串页)。真机 validation 全 0 + 落笔 bbox
  与 plan 一致。纯函数 `planPartitions` 用 issue 真实 6 模块 A4 数据单测。

### Fixed — autoconnect 标题栏硬约束 + 创建后兜底 + partial + 真实尺寸 stagger (issue #146/#147/#148)
- **标题栏软惩罚→硬拒绝**(#147):`scoreCandidate` 里图签命中从 `costTitleBlock=10000` 改
  `costHardReject`,四方向全进图签时明确失败,否则主动转向安全方向(不再把 netport 落进明细表)。
- **创建后真实 bbox 兜底**(#147 DoD2):批量后回读真实 bbox,凡侵入图签 keep-out 的 marker 连
  wire 一并删除并判失败——绝不「返回成功且图签上留 marker」。
- **partial 报告**(#146):`acReport` 加 `partial`/`succeeded`/`failed`,批量中断后只补失败 pin,
  不重放整份 spec(避免在已连 pin 上叠重复标识)。
- **真实尺寸 stagger**(#148 Phase-2):打分用的 `labelBox` 从固定 8×8 换成贴近实测的 marker 框
  (~24×11);旧 8×8 在 10-pitch 平行脚永不与邻居相交、stagger 从不触发,真实 11-高框相交 →
  规划器自动挑不同 offset 错开。真机 ch340c:相邻 GND 脚 offset 交替 18/36,marker-overlap 24-28→9。

### Fixed — A4 图签 keep-out 只圈住右半的根因 + A4 优先标定
- **根因**:`deriveSheetGeometry` 的 A4 横版比例只有 `{0.22,0.14}` → keep-out `(912.6,0)..(1170,115.5)`
  只覆盖图签**右半的日期列**,左半(原理图/Schematic1/Board1/ceshi)全露在外。所有吃这个 keep-out
  的检查(#147 硬拒绝/门、#149 分区抬升、#141 避让)一致误报「0 覆盖」而真实图签左半持续被压。
- 真机 overlay 标定实测真实图签 ≈ 宽 60%×高 20%,改 `{0.6,0.2}` → `(468,0)..(1170,165)` 完整框住整表。
- **A4 优先**:图签是**定尺寸表格**不随页面等比缩放,故该比例只对 A4 准。新增 `isA4LandscapeSize`,
  非 A4 A 系列横版(A3+)仍给 best-effort keep-out 但**降级 `source:fallback-ratio` + warn「calibrated
  for A4 landscape only」**,让非 A4 的 keep-out 永不被当硬门静默信任。

### Fixed — 批量删除静默失效:`sch clear` 一直在谎报清空
- **根因是平台的 `eda.sch_Primitive*.delete(ids)` 在大批量上静默 no-op 并返回 `true`。**
  实测同一页:1/5/20/50 个 → 全删掉;58 个 → 全删掉;**134 个一次调用 → 一个没删,返回值照样 `true`**。
  是**尺寸上限**而非「某个图元删不掉」——那次失败的 134 里剩下的 58 个单独删就干净。
- **`schematic.page.clear` 此前把「枚举到 N 个」当成「删除了 N 个」上报**:一次 232 图元的 clear
  报 `total: 232` 成功,实际只删掉 5 个、227 个存活。调用方合理地把成功读成「页面已空」,
  于是一个逐块回归脚本在 clear 之间静默累积了三个块的元件,污染了整轮测量数据。
- 三处修复:① `deleteSchGroup` **分批 50/批**(clear 与所有图元类删除共用);
  ② `schematic.page.clear` 改为 delete→**重新枚举**→循环收敛(上限 6 轮,无进展即停),
  并诚实上报 `enumerated` / `total`(真正消失的数量)/ `remaining` / `passes`,没清干净时带 warning;
  ③ `schematic.component.delete` 同样分批,并**回读校验**,返回 `requested` / `removed` / `survived`
  而不是那个会撒谎的布尔。真机验证:538 图元一次 clear → `passes: 1, remaining: 0`。
- **通用教训**:平台的删除类 API 返回值不可信,批量操作后必须回读确认。

### Added — `sch extract-layout` 反向导出块模板 (issue #140)
- **`easyeda sch extract-layout <block-id>`**:block-apply 模板步骤的**逆操作**——读活动页上一个摆好的
  块实例,按每个 role 的实测 anchor + rotation 反算出块的 `schematic_layout` 模板(role→{dx,dy,rotation},
  相对确定性锚点,自动吸 5 格、rotation 归一到 {0,90,180,270})。把「在真板上把外设摆漂亮一次→固化模板」
  从肉眼盯板手写 dx/dy 变成数据管线(20 块里 18 块还缺模板就是因为纯手工)。**两个设计决策确定性落定**:
  ① role→designator 用 `--role ROLE=DESIG` 显式(优先)+ `--from D1,D2,…` 按**唯一前缀**自动匹配,歧义/未命中
  直接报错绝不瞎猜;② 锚点=按 role 名排序后首个前缀为 "U"(芯片/MCU)的 role,否则排序首个 role,重复导出稳定不漂。
  **v1 只 PRINT 模板 JSON 供复审**(不写回 go:embed 数据——回写要保 JSON 键序,Go map 序列化会打乱全部键→不可读 diff),
  复审后粘进 `internal/blocks/data/<id>.json` 再跑 `go test ./internal/blocks/...` 过全 role 覆盖 + on-grid + 合法
  rotation 校验。纯函数单测覆盖(前缀提取/rotation 归一/role 反查歧义与缺失/相对偏移计算);`--write` 就地回写待
  保序写入器就位后加。真机 extract→回写→新页 block-apply→layout-lint 一致性待活体编辑器验收。

### Added — 分区自动画框接入自动放置流程 (issue #142)
- **`sch autolayout --engine template --apply` 落完自动 `zone-draw`**:此前功能分区可视化
  (虚线区域框+区名)是 `sch zones set` + `sch zone-draw` 两步手动跟进;现在模板引擎 `--apply`
  成功后,按 `--spec` 的 `modules[].zone` 自动持久化分区认领(`SetSchZones`,`sch zones status`/
  layout-lint 可见)并用**与 zone-violation 同一 `zoneRect` 几何**画出区域框+区名——「先看区、
  再看线」成为放置流程一等公民。复用既有 `buildZoneDrawJS`,frame primitive id 记入 workflow
  state,`sch zone-draw --clear` 精确移除、不碰用户图形。新 flag `--zone-draw`(默认开,
  `--zone-draw=false` 关闭);无 sheet bbox / 无 zoned module 时静默跳过,best-effort 不影响布局。
  纯函数单测覆盖(`TestBuildAutolayoutZoneClaims`);真机「多块页自动出现分区框」待活体编辑器验收。
  block-apply 的 category→zone 自动分区 + 去耦分组文本注释(需先定 category→zone 映射/`default_zone`
  方案)留作后续,不在本次范围。

### Fixed — `--engine official` 兜底增强 (issue #143)
- **`connect_pin` 网格判定容忍浮点残差**:吸附把件 anchor 修到整 5 格,但引脚坐标 = anchor +
  旋转偏移,旋转数学引入 FP 噪声(引脚落 649.9999999 而非 650),旧的严格相等网格判定把合法引脚
  误判为 off-grid 而拒连(官方 `--rewire` 残留 ~7 条失败连接)。现引入 `GRID_EPS=0.01`:先 round
  到最近格、与网格点距离 <0.01 即视为 on-grid;并把**桩的引脚侧顶点吸到整格**(`pinGX/pinGY`),使
  短桩真正轴对齐(0.0001 的斜桩会让 flag 悬空/EasyEDA 拒建)同时仍 <0.01 贴合真实引脚→照常连通。
  `GRID_EPS` 远 < 半格,真正 off-grid(半格 2.5)仍正确拒绝。顺带修好 `offset==0` 重叠检查(旧逻辑
  在 FP 引脚下漏判)。
- **官方 `autoLayout` 喂 `designatorDeviceTypeMap`**:此前裸调无参;现从页面真实位号前缀分类
  (R→resistor / C→capacitor / L·FB→inductive / D·LED→diode / Q→triode / Y·X→oscillator /
  U·IC→chip / 其余→otherDevice)构建 designator→type map 注入,官方算法按角色更聚拢地摆放。空 map
  降级为裸调;传多余 props 对忽略它的旧构建无害。Go 单测覆盖分类器 + map 构建;真机连通率/布局效果
  待活体编辑器验收。

### Fixed — block-apply 消费标题栏 keep-out (issue #141)
- **`sch block-apply` 原点避碰纳入 A4 标题栏图签**:此前 `bapResolveOrigin` 只把已有器件的
  真实 bbox 当障碍,块落在纸面偏右下会压到 A4 右下角图签/明细表。现在从 `bapResolveOrigin`
  的同一次 `components.list(includeBBox)` 里顺手取 `"sheet"` bbox,复用 `titleBlockKeepout`
  (autoconnect/autolayout 共用的 keep-out 单一几何源)派生标题栏矩形,追加进螺旋找空位的障碍集
  ——不显式 `--at` 时自动避开图签;显式 `--at` 仍尊重坐标但碰撞(器件或图签)会 warn。无 sheet
  bbox 时降级为不强制(与其它调用方一致)。纯函数单测覆盖(`TestPlanBlockApplyOriginDodgesTitleBlock`
  / `…ExplicitAtOverTitleBlock`);真机 0-overlap 且块 bbox 不与图签相交待活体编辑器验收。

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added — PCB SVG 丝印导入 (issue #139)
- **`pcb.silk.import_svg` / `pcb silk-import-svg`**:把 SVG(LOGO / 品牌标 / 图形)作为**填充**
  丝印图元导入(`eda.pcb_PrimitiveImage.create`)——**无需 `debug.exec_js`** 的 typed 路径。新增
  Go 侧 SVG 解析器 `internal/pcb/svgimport`:解析 path(`M/L/H/V/C/S/Q/T/A/Z`)、`polygon`/
  `polyline`/`rect`/`circle`/`ellipse`/`line`、嵌套 `transform`、viewBox,**曲线全部扁平化为线段**,
  输出 EDA 复杂多边形命令数组(轮廓 + **even-odd 挖孔**,LOGO 的孔洞如 "o" 中空自动镂空)。
  Flag:`--file`/`--svg`、`--x/--y`(或 `--at`)=图形左上角、`--width`/`--height`/`--keep-aspect`、
  `--layer`(3 顶 / 4 底自动镜像)、`--rotation`/`--mirror`,以及 **`--dry-run`**(CLI 侧,打印目标
  bbox / 轮廓数 / 顶点数 / 最小特征 + 低于 `--min-line-width`≈6mil 的 DFM 告警)。**ceshi 真机验证**:
  顶/底丝印可建、孔洞镂空、旋转+镜像生效、**扛过 `doc reload` + `pcb save`**(同 primitiveId/bbox)、
  `pcb check` 干净。关键判据:`pcb_PrimitiveImage` 直接吃丝印层的复杂多边形,填充 LOGO **无需**描边化
  或光栅化(推翻初始范围风险)。填充规则为 even-odd,纯描边图形按填充处理。星火计划 LOGO 品牌素材
  示例待授权确认(下载链接 + SHA-256,不再分发)。

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added — 原理图放置方法论(一套自己的摆放方法)
- **块 `schematic_layout` 模板**:电路块 JSON 新增 `schematic_layout`(role → `{dx,dy,rotation}`
  相对坐标模板,y-UP、5 格对齐、须覆盖全部 role,schema + `go test` 双校验)。`sch block-apply`
  优先按模板落件(去耦贴电源脚一字排开/上拉靠引脚/晶振·FLASH 分列,信号流左入右出,人审一次
  终身复用),无模板才退回网格;**原点自动避碰**(不显式 `--at` 时按已有器件真实 bbox 螺旋找空位)、
  落后回读真实 bbox 把 overlap 写进 manifest。esp32s3r8_chip_minsys / led_indicator_gpio 首批带模板。
- **`sch zones` 功能分区认领 + `layout-lint` zone-violation**:S0 spec 的 `modules[].zone` 持久化,
  `sch layout-lint` 新增"认领件落在分区矩形外"的 WARN(与 PCB zones 独立)。
- **`sch zone-draw` 分区框可视化**:把认领画成虚线区域框 + 区名文本(`eda.sch_PrimitiveRectangle/Text`),
  与 zone-violation 同一几何,所见即所校验;`--clear` 精确移除,不碰用户图形。
- **`sch align` / `sch distribute`**:按真实渲染 bbox 对齐(left/right/top/bottom/centerx/centery)/
  等距摊开,默认 dry-run、`--apply` 落地自检;补齐 design-flow S6 一直引用却不存在的命令。
- **`sch autolayout --engine official` 官方 autoLayout 兜底引擎**:包装平台 `eda.sch_Document.autoLayout()`
  (@beta,3.2.148 起可用)。它对已连线页是**破坏性**的(移件不移线 → 断线、落 off-grid),故加安全管线:
  **已连线守卫**(无 `--rewire` 拒绝)、**跑后吸附 5 格**、`--rewire`(跑前捕获网表 → autoLayout → 吸附 →
  删断线 → 重连)、自检用 `sch check`(查断线)不止 `layout-lint`(查重叠)。定位:模板未命中页的兜底起点。

### Added — 机制
- **`--doc <uuid|name>` 全局 flag**:根治 doc-switch racing。所有命令默认对"当前前台文档"操作而
  `doc switch` 异步,长命令(autoLayout ~2min)/跨命令时前台漂移会把编辑落到错误的页。`--doc` 在
  `postAction` 咽喉点加守卫:变更动作(catalog `Mutates`)落地前 `ensureActiveDoc` 切目标页并用**实时
  `document.current`** 确认(不看缓存 /health),确认不了**拒绝**而非编辑错页;导航动作豁免防递归。
  真机验证:前台停 P2 时 `block-apply --doc P1` 稳稳落 P1、P2 不动。**多页/长操作一律带 `--doc`。**

### Fixed
- **原理图坐标系 y-UP 定音**:双探针文本实测 3.2.148 画布为 y-UP(y 大=视觉上方),修正 `zoneRect`
  的 top/bottom 映射(此前按 y-DOWN 写反,autolayout/zone-violation/zone-draw 上下翻转)、标题栏
  keep-out 锚点(此前保护右上角,实际标题栏在右下)、`sch align --mode top/bottom` 语义。

## [0.15.2] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **#127 `pcb.track.lock`**:按 net(string 或 string[])和/或 primitiveIds 批量**锁定/解锁**
  铜皮布线图元(track/arc/via)。P7.0 关键网络先行流程的最后一步——电源+差分先布好后锁定,
  后续自动布线/rip-up 动不了(rip_up 本就跳过 locked)。拒绝空过滤(不隐式锁全板);幂等
  (已处于目标状态的只计数不重写);逐图元 `setState_PrimitiveLock` + `done()`(#134 教训)。
  CLI 侧配套:`pcb track-lock` 子命令 + `pcb route-critical`(电源铺铜→差分成对布线+skew
  实测→锁定,一条命令承载 design-flow P7.0)。

## [0.15.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **#135 `schematic.bridgeCheck` 线段级锚定**:flag/pin 归树从「顶点邻近」改为「点到线段距离」。
  EasyEDA 把两条重叠共线 stub 合并成一条线后,被吞的 flag 落在**线段中段**,顶点判定永远锚不上
  ——一树双网的真短路因此漏报为 0 findings(ina226 块验证实录)。同时新增 **ORPHAN_FLAG** 检测:
  不挨任何导线的 netflag/netport(删合并线留下的孤儿)单列上报,防止新画的线静默继承其网名。
- **#136 `schematic.components.list` 跨页撞号免疫**:同一 designator 在文档内解析出多个不同
  device 身份时(跨页撞号;子部件 U1.A/U1.B 同身份不误伤),该件 pin 的 net 强制置 null 并标
  `netAmbiguous:true`——netlist 按 designator.pin 全文档取网,撞号时归属被毒化,给错网比不给更糟。
  CLI 侧配套:`sch block-apply` 分配代号改查**全文档**(不再只看当前页);`sch autoconnect` 对撞号
  件显式告警;block-apply 收尾新增 **netlist↔plan 对账门**(#135),不一致非零退出。
- **#137 `schematic.power.connect_pin` 瞬态重试 + 回滚**:建 stub 线瞬态失败自动重试一次(250ms),
  终错带端点坐标;flag 创建失败时**回滚已建的线**,不再留无 flag 孤儿桩。
- **#137 `schematic.pin.disconnect` 合并树感知**:定位到的线可能是合并树——flag 搜索从「仅两端点」
  扩到**全折线(顶点+中段)**,一并删除失宿 flag;新增 `alsoDisconnectedPins` 返回字段,列出因删线
  被连带断开的其它 pin,调用方可据此重连。
- **`sch autoconnect` 同批次短桩互斥**(#138,自 #133 Bug 1 拆出):此前每个连接
  只对「既存」图元评分,同一批里刚规划的短桩互相不可见——同器件相邻异网引脚
  (隔离 DC-DC B0512S 类四域脚)会选出共线相触的短桩,被 EasyEDA 合并成隐性
  多网短路(真机:CS/CS1/CS2 地网全部并入 GND)。现在每个已规划短桩立即以
  目标网注册回 scene 当作既存导线,后续连接沿用 #64 的异网触碰硬拒——自动换
  方向/offset 错开,四向全堵时响亮报 "no safe candidate" 拒绝落笔而非放置
  短路桩。两条 httptest 回归覆盖「转向错开」与「全堵响亮失败」。

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **⚠BREAKING:连接器扫描端口段从 `49620-49629` 迁移到 `60832-60841`(`0xEDA0`-`0xEDA9`)**。
  旧段是当初照抄官方 `eext-run-api-gateway` 的约定(docs/ecosystem-survey.md),导致
  官方生态的外部工具和我们的 daemon **抢同一个端口绑定**(先起的占 49620,后起的挤走
  或抖动)。新段把 "EDA" 直接写进十六进制端口号,专属、好记、零冲突。
  **升级须知**:daemon(CLI)与连接器必须**同时**升到本版本——新连接器只扫新段,
  旧 daemon(≤0.14.x,监听 49620)将永远连不上,反之亦然;`--ports` 手动指定旧段
  可临时兼容旧连接器。

## [0.14.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **`schematic.pin.set_no_connect` 真正生成非连接 X 标识(订正 0.5.14 的平台 no-op 误诊)**:
  真机复现确认 `setState_NoConnected(...)` 只修改当前 pin 句柄的待提交状态,必须再
  `await pin.done()` 才会写回画布;此前 handler 漏掉 `done()`,fresh readback 因而恢复
  `false`,被误判成 EasyEDA Pro 3.2.x 平台限制。现在改走
  `sch_PrimitiveComponent.get(id) → component.getAllPins()`,逐脚 setter + `done()`,再用
  新器件实例回读验证。Pro 3.2.149 真机已确认绿色 X 出现、`noConnected:true`,且
  `sch check` 的 floating-pin 计数同步减少;`--clear` 同路径持久化清除。
  (#133 Bug 3 / #134, 感谢 @zhiqiangme 贡献)
- **skill 脚本 Windows 中文环境 GBK 解码崩溃**(#133 Bug 4):bulk-connect /
  bulk-place / sch / diff 四脚本的 `subprocess.run` 显式 `encoding='utf-8',
  errors='replace'`——CLI 输出恒为 UTF-8,此前 `text=True` 在 Windows 中文环境
  按系统 GBK 解码,器件描述含中文时 `UnicodeDecodeError` 崩溃。
- **文档**:environment-setup.md 新增 PowerShell 5.1 吞 JSON 参数双引号的说明
  与绕行(`--%` / 反引号转义 / CSV 形式 / PowerShell 7+)(#133 Bug 5)。

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-18

**「真机可信化」版**:一天内 16 个 issue 闭环的集中发布。三大主题:
① **via/导入可信化**——EPAD 内嵌热过孔的删除欺骗与赋网易失被彻底摸清(删不掉:
假成功+立即 getAll 也骗+reload 原 id 复活;赋网只活到 reload),`pcb.route.delete`
前置拒删、`pcb.add_component` 放置即键合、CLI 新增 `pcb via-bond` 幂等重键合 +
`pcb check` netless-via-in-pad 触发器;**import-changes 十七天误诊破案**——它从来
不是 no-op,是「确认导入信息」对话框没人点,现在 handler 自动点「应用修改」,
clear→reimport 往返打通。② **布线器硬否决**——异网走线/slot 从代价升级为
hopFeasible 硬门(R2 两条真交叉短路的根治),mount-holes 反查既有铜皮。
③ **门禁与工具诚实化**——power-not-poured 对 GND 内电层死锁解除(PlanePouredNets
状态互通)、`--force` 分级放行(零确认机械骨架要 `--force-unsafe`)、`pcb clear`
默认 verify 复合流程、高 pin 连接器不再抢 main、陶瓷贴片天线 keepout、
根级 `easyeda health` 别名。

### Fixed
- **`pcb.import_changes` 假 no-op 根因修复(#124,订正 #20 诊断)**:importChanges 一直
  都能正确算出变更清单——它弹「确认导入信息」对话框等人点「应用修改」,API 返回 true 只
  代表**对话框弹出**;headless 没人点,看起来就是静默 no-op(「不支持增量导入」是误诊)。
  真机实证:点击后 20 件全部落板。handler 现在自动等待对话框并点「应用修改」
  (`confirm:false` 保留人工审查),且 importChanges 的 promise **不再串行 await**
  (实测某些状态下永不 resolve,会卡死连接器整个动作队列)——改为并发点击 + 12s 超时
  兜底,以器件计数差(componentsBefore/After)为落板真值。
- **`pcb.route.delete` 假报成功修复(#120,真机订正)**:SDK 的 `delete()` 对**封装内嵌
  via**(QFN EPAD 热过孔是 component 的一部分)返回 `true` 且**立即 getAll 也显示已删**,
  但 save/reload 后从封装定义原 id 复活(ceshi 真机实证)——纯 readback 会被骗。handler
  现在**前置结构判定**:via id 以某器件 primitiveId 为前缀 = 内嵌,直接拒删进
  `notDeletable[]`(附父器件 + 指引 `pcb via-bond`),`ok:false`;其余照常删除并
  readback 兜底(`removed`/`count` 只统计真正消失的,不可归因的幸存者进 `notDeleted`)。
- **`pcb.add_component` 内嵌 via 赋网(#118)**:封装内嵌的 EPAD 热过孔 `net=""`,
  EPAD 永远焊不上 GND 平面且每颗报一条 same-footprint SMD Pad to Via。现在赋完
  pad 网后,枚举落在本器件已赋网 pad 铜皮矩形内的无网 via,用
  `pcb_PrimitiveVia.modify`(@beta)赋成该 pad 的网,并 readback 验证(#120 教训:
  SDK 布尔不可信);结果新增 `embeddedVias {assigned, verified, failed}`。
  ⚠️ 真机实证:该赋网**不能活过 doc reload**(平台每次都把内嵌 via 重物化为无网)——
  CLI 侧配套 `pcb via-bond`(exec_js 路线,旧连接器即可用)负责 reload 后重键合,
  `pcb check` 新规则 netless-via-in-pad 是触发器。

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-16

**「规范进代码」版**:PCB 设计规范从「文档等 AI 自觉去读」变成**机器强制**——26 条
`pcb check` 规则的报错自带 `[规范 §N]` 章节引用、布完线必须过 `post_route_checked`
门才能进交付、电源线宽按公制阶梯自动给宽。配套补齐芯片级(ESP32-S3 裸片)选型与电路块,
并新增 `pcb clear` / `pcb mount-holes` 两条命令。

### Added
- **`pcb.page.clear` — 一键整版清空 PCB**(`easyeda pcb clear`),`schematic.page.clear`
  的 PCB 对称版。一次删掉所有板级内容:器件 + 布线(轨/弧/过孔)+ 铺铜/填充 + keep-out/规则区域
  + 自由丝印(丝印层 3/4 的字符串**及线/弧图形**,不误删铜层文字或机械/装配图元)。
  `pcb.component.delete` 只删器件、布线/铺铜会静默残留;这个才是真正的清板重来。
  **默认保留锁定图元 + 板框(layer 11)**;`--only components,routing,copper,regions,silk` 收窄、
  `--no-preserve-outline` 连板框删、`--include-locked` 连锁定件删。`--dry-run` 只统计不删。
  复用 `rip_up` 的 copper-only 规则,布线永不误伤丝印/板框。无 undo,确认门控。
  **内部枚举→删除→再枚举循环到 0**(上限 5 轮,返回 `rounds`)——首轮枚举可能读到 stale
  引擎态漏项(实测 153 轨清完仍剩 8),循环补清等价于用户手工再跑一遍;dry-run 不循环;
  撞轮次上限仍有残留则追加 warning 提示 save+reload 再跑,绝不假报干净(#112)。
- **`easyeda pcb mount-holes` — 四角 M3 安装孔自动放置**(#102):读板框 bbox 四角内缩放孔
  (`--dia` 默认 126mil=Ø3.2mm / `--inset` 197mil≈5mm / `--corners tl,tr,bl,br` 子集 /
  `--dry-run`)。孔形态 = layer-12 多边形 fill(与 `pcb slot` 同原语,零新增 action);
  keep-out = max(孔半径+40, 垫圈118mil),圆-矩形相交逐角查器件 bbox,**冲突警告+跳过,
  绝不压件**;已有孔报 `exists`(幂等重跑)。
- **`post_route_checked` 阶段门 —— 「布完必查」机械化**(#97 续):`workflow advance` 在
  布线后自动跑 `pcb check`,**ERROR + power-not-poured + width-under-spec 三项清零**才放行
  丝印/交付;其余 WARN 报告不拦。13 个布线类 action 标 `InvalidatesStage` → 改线后门
  自动重新关上。拒门时逐条打印 blocking finding(自带 `[规范 §N]` 引用)。
- **`easyeda pcb modify --center`**(#105):`--x/--y` 解释为**期望的 bbox 中心**而非器件
  锚点(锚点常偏中心,实测 ESP32 模组偏 135mil,旋转件更甚);`pcb list --include-bbox`
  输出注入 `center` 字段。默认语义不变。
- **`pcb fill create --at x,y --size w,h`** 别名(#109):消除 `--rect` = 两角点的歧义。
- **audit 客户端归因 + 并发写 advisory**(#108):Request 带 `clientId`
  (`<hostname>:<pid>[:EASYEDA_CLIENT_LABEL]`),audit JSONL 每行可归因;不同会话 10 分钟内
  写同一板 → 响应附 `concurrentWriter` 警告(不阻断,CLI 打 stderr)。
- **`staleRisk` advisory —— 铁律 5 机械化**:PCB mutation 后未 `doc reload` 就读/DRC →
  daemon 在响应附警告(CLI stderr),`pour-rebuild`/reload 后自动解除。
- **芯片级(ESP32-S3 裸片)物料链**:`standard-parts.json` 补 6 类选型(#106,S3R8 裸片
  C2913194 内封 8MB PSRAM / W25Q64 / APS6404L / 40MHz 晶振 / 2.4G 陶瓷天线 / π 匹配);
  电路块库新增 2 个 draft 块 `block.esp32s3r8_chip_minsys` + `block.ant_2g4_ceramic_pi`
  (共 23 块:20 ready / 3 draft)。
- **`pcb.components.list --include-pads` 返回焊盘真实铜皮 `width`/`height`**、
  **`pcb.silk.list` 返回 `fontSize`**(0.12.1 起):clearance/DFM/避障从名义常量升级实测值。
- **PCB 设计规范手册**(`.agents/skills/pcbpilot/references/pcb-design-rules.md`):13 章,
  JLC 工艺 + IPC-2221;`pcb check` 报错的 `[规范 §N]` 即指向此手册章节。
- **`sch bridge-check` 规则类型化**:`wire-bridge`(ERROR)/`orphan-stub`(WARN),
  JSON 可按类型 gate,对齐 `pcb check` 强制力。

### Changed
- **`pcb check` 新增 5 条 DFM 规则**(共 26 条),全部自带 `[规范 §N]` 引用:
  `silk-over-pad`(§11.2 丝印压焊盘)、`decap-too-far`(§3.1 去耦电容离 IC >2.5mm)、
  `via-in-pad`(§2.3 同网过孔打在焊盘上)、`copper-near-edge`(§5.1 铜距板边)、
  `fiducial-missing`(§9 SMT 板缺 Mark 点,INFO)。旧的 11 类规则也补上了章节引用。
- **net-class 线宽阶梯改公制圆整**(规范 §1.2):电源分档从 mil 碎值(10/15/20mil =
  0.254/0.381/0.508mm)改为公制推荐值 **branch 0.25mm / trunk 0.4mm / high-current 0.5mm**
  (9.84/15.75/19.69mil);signal 仍取板的 live 规则值。存量按旧阶梯布的板零追溯告警。
- **`easyeda pcb power-pour`**:2 层板电源自动铺铜(`power-planes` 的 2 层版)——GND 全板
  pour + 各电源轨局部**动态 pour**(非 static fill,防异网短路)。
- **删除类命令统一收 CSV 与 JSON 数组**(#109):`pcb delete` / `pour-delete` /
  `region delete` / `fill delete` / `track-delete` / `via-delete` —— `pcb drc --json`
  的 `objs` 数组现在可直接粘贴。

### Fixed
- **clearance 判据改铜皮边缘距**:track↔pad / via↔pad 原按径向 max(w,h)/2 判(USB-C 长条
  焊盘旁的合法走线被误报 21 条);track↔via / track↔track 原按**中心线**距判并打印,导致
  「runs 16.9mil — under the 6mil rule」自相矛盾文案,且**两条 10mil 线中心距 8mil(铜皮
  已重叠)竟放行 = 漏报短路**。现全部按真实矩形/半宽算边缘距。
- **route-short detour 段 fine-pitch 收窄改子段级**(#107):原为整 hop 级,任一端点落在
  密脚场就把整条多层绕行(含对侧层电源 trunk)连坐收窄到 6mil,载流严重不足。
- **workflow 指纹 reload 后误报 placement drift**(#100):坐标取整放粗到 1mil + 压平
  -0.0、旋转折进 [0,360)、layer 数字与名称统一映射;顺带修掉 `asString` 读数字 layer 恒
  空串导致**翻面对指纹不可见**的隐藏 bug。
- **`place-constrained` 检测不到 slot 挖的 M3 孔**(#104,holes 恒 0 → Tier-1 避让失明):
  根因是解析 `pcb.fill.list` 的 `points` 字段,而连接器只在 `includeBBox` 里给几何。
- **`via-crosses-plane` 的「plane 无网」分支降为 INFO**(#110):实证 PLANE 层 pour 在
  `doc reload` 后被装进负片存储、扩展 API 无任何读取路径(平台行为,非本项目 bug),
  该分支在 reload 后必然假阳性 → 不再计入 warnings/拦 `--strict`,message 指引以
  `pcb drc` Connection=0 为准。
- **`pcb.silk_netnames` 碰撞检测**从硬编码 50×50mil 改真实焊盘 extent。
- **`--dry-run` 预览不再被当成 mutation**(#112):daemon 侧统一按 payload 的 `dryRun`
  标志把预览排除出 `Mutates` 判定 —— 之前只跑 `pcb clear --dry-run`(不改板)也会 arm
  `staleRisk` 并触发 autosave;现在 staleRisk / autosave / concurrentWriter 三处一致。
- **`workflow advance` 门失败时非零退出**(#113):post_route_checked 拒门(或门跑不起来)
  时 exit≠0,脚本 `set -e` / CI 循环终于拦得住;与既有「阻塞在人工签核时非零」OR 合并。
- **门与 `power-planes` 不再自相矛盾**(#114):`power-planes` 判定「内层已被占用 → 该网
  改走线」(`routeAsTracks`)的电源网记进 workflow state,post_route_checked 门豁免其
  `power-not-poured`(仍打印并标注 exempt)。此前两个工具互相打架:去铺撞已有平面、
  不铺过不了门。豁免跟着**布局**失效(placement_confirmed 及更早)而非布线。
- **`bom export` 定位 `bom-enrich.py`**(#115):六级探测(`--script` → `EASYEDA_SKILLS_DIR`
  → 已安装 skill 目录(复用 `skill status` 同一份逻辑) → 可执行文件兄弟路径 → cwd → `$PATH`),
  非仓库 cwd 下不再找不到;找不到时列出**每一条**探测过的路径。

## [0.12.1] - 2026-07-14

结束「pad 尺寸靠猜」时代:焊盘/丝印把**真实几何**送到 Go 侧,所有 clearance/DFM/避障
规则从名义常量升级到实测值。

### Added
- **`pcb.components.list --include-pads` 返回每个 pad 的真实铜皮尺寸 `width`/`height`**
  (mil,轴对齐,已按 pad rotation 换轴)——从 `getState_Pad()` 形状元组提取
  (ELLIPSE/OVAL/RECT/NGON;复杂多边形 pad 无廉价 extent,省略字段,消费方回退名义值)。
  Go 侧 `pcb check` 的 clearance / via-in-pad / silk-over-pad 与 `route-short` 避障
  即刻消费:大焊盘(USB 壳/散热盘)不再漏报,0201 小盘不再误报。
- **`pcb.silk.list` 返回每条丝印文本的 `fontSize`**(mil;attribute 与 free string 都带)——
  `pcb check` silk-over-pad 的文本 extent 从「40mil 假设」升级为真实字号估算。

### Changed
- `pcb.silk_netnames` 的碰撞检测 pad 尺寸从硬编码 50×50 改为真实 extent(同上回退)。

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-14

本版把**项目工作流机械化**(#97)、补上**手焊可达门**(#99)、让 `place-constrained`
**网感知分组连接器**,并修掉三处在 esp32Mini 端到端回归里暴露的工具张力(Type-C 突出板框、
beautify 圆角与 `pcb check` 的弧不感知)。

### Added
- **项目 design-flow 状态机机械强制(#97)**:新增 `easyeda workflow`(init / status /
  advance / confirm / reset)——6 段门(imported→placement_ready→placement_confirmed→
  outline_confirmed→pre_route_passed→routing_authorized)。daemon 在 `/action` 层**拦截
  未授权布线**(`pcb.line.create` / `pcb.via.create` / `pcb.import_autoroute`,fail-closed);
  布局/朝向类 action 携带指纹,任何 mutation **自动失效**下游确认并全链回退。
- **手焊铁路门(#99)**:`pcb layout-lint --gate` 增加**手焊可达**检查——每个器件至少一侧有
  ≥60mil 净通道(否则「四面被围」判 fail);配 `pcb stage set-assembly hand-solder`
  落盘的装配档(min-gap 40 / large-pad 60)。
- **`pcb.line.list` 返回 copper 弧(`arcs`)**:与 `lines` 并列返回圆弧图元的端点,向后兼容
  (旧 CLI 忽略新字段)。让 headless 检查能把「track 端接在弧端点」识别为已连,而非悬空。

### Changed
- **`place-constrained` 网感知分组**:`edge="user-facing"` 的连接器(USB / SD / 端子 / 排针)
  **分组到同一条共享边**并沿边紧凑排布;共享边由**网感知**选(贴连接器电气搭档主芯片的那条边,
  经共享 local 网,而非几何质心)——USB 贴 CH340 同侧,缩短差分对、少交叉(实测同种子 61→28 交叉)。
  `edge="any"`(RF/模组)保持各自最近边。

### Fixed
- **`layout-lint` off-board 改按焊盘中心判**:连接器身/courtyard 突出板框(Type-C mating 面、
  卡座、螺钉端子)但**焊盘全在框内**属有意贴边,不再误判 off-board、不再卡死 confirm-layout
  授权链;无焊盘件兜底 bbox(焊盘边到板框净空仍归 DRC)。
- **`pcb check` 弧感知(消除 beautify 圆角伪报)**:`beautify` 把拐角圆化成 track→arc→track 后,
  `dangling-end` 与 `floating-track-island` 两个检测因**不认弧**而爆假阳性(实测一块板 dangling
  0→130、island 0→10,而官方 DRC 报 0 断)。现 `dangling-end` 认「同层弧端点=track 端已连」、
  `floating-track-island` 用**弧桥接** union(镜像过孔桥接)——实测两者双双归零。

## [0.11.3] - 2026-07-12

守护进程端口稳定性(补丁):

### Fixed
- **多 daemon 抢端口根治**:daemon 改为**单一固定端口 49620**(不再顺移到 49621…)。旧行为下
  第二个 `daemon start` 会悄悄占下一个端口,而连接器扫整段 49620–49629 会**在多个 daemon 间抖**
  (陈年 `make dev`/air 实例的典型症状);旧 PID 文件兜底不可靠。新的 `ensurePortAvailable`:
  空闲→绑;被**我方 daemon** 占(`/health` 探测确认)→**自动替换**(端口级,可靠);被**别的
  程序**占→交互终端问 `[y/N]`、headless(air/nohup 无 TTY)报清晰错误退出——**绝不静默杀外部
  进程**。连接器侧不用改(仍扫 49620–49629,先命中 49620)。

## [0.11.2] - 2026-07-12

本版聚焦 **PCB 布局智能** 与 **电路块库扩张**,并将连接器上架官方插件市场。

### Added
- **电路块库扩张(~15 个新拓扑块 + 两批器件入库)**:sy8089 3V3 同步 buck、tps63802
  buck-boost、usbc_ufp_power_or(USB-C 设备口 + VBUS 二极管 OR)、ch334f USB2.0 四口 hub、
  bq24074 power-path 充电、vehicle_input 车载 12–24V 前端 + tps54360 车规 buck、
  pmos_highside 高侧软启动、opto_acc_ign 车载 ACC/点火检测、axp2101 PMU 等。
- **`easyeda pcb antenna-keepout`(新命令)**:按块声明(`keepout.end_frac`)自动为
  RF/天线器件在**每个铜层**(MULTI 层)生成 no-copper 禁铜区——只盖模组**无焊盘的天线端**
  (不孤立接地焊盘)、幂等;`--dry-run` / `--pad-clearance`。
- **边缘端子自动定向**:块声明连接器开口方向(`openings:[{match,local}]`),
  `pcb place-constrained` 据此把螺钉端子等**开口自动转向板外**;焊盘对称且块未声明的
  连接器则**显式提示手工确认**(不凭焊盘几何乱猜)。
- **连接器上架[立创EDA官方插件市场](https://jlc-ext.com/item/zhoushoujian/easyeda-agent-connector)**
  —— 新增市场一键安装通道,平台可**原地自动更新**;侧载 GitHub Release `.eext` 仍与 CLI
  **严格同版**,是四件套对齐的权威来源(市场版本可能滞后 CLI,每次发版需网页端手动重新提审)。

### Changed / Fixed — PCB 布局智能(place-constrained 大修)
- 器件分类改**消费块 placement 数据**(位号前缀)而非硬编码正则 + 新增显式 `anchor` 档;
  分类字符串改用真 `manufacturerId` 而非 `"={Manufacturer Part}"` 模板(修 WROOM 被误判为
  主芯片、连接器按名认不出)。
- 边缘吸附读**真板框**(`pcb.outline.get`)而非件云 bbox;Tier-4 卫星**按共网聚类**到
  所属芯片(优先局部信号网)。
- **对抗审查修 6 个潜在 bug**:天线 keepout 不再压焊盘(`--pad-clearance` 让开焊盘本体)、
  块 `_doc` 键不再丢整块 placement、天线幂等收紧(只认 MULTI 层全铜禁铜)、netSeed 优先
  局部网、天线器件识别在 `pcb check` 与生成器两侧对齐。

### Verified
- `go test ./...` 全绿;**ceshi 真机逐条验证**(WROOM 模组 `main`→`edge`、J1 螺钉端子开口
  朝外、天线 keepout `pcb check` loop 0→1→0);两轮多 agent **对抗审查**复核 5 个 review 修复
  (0 新增回归)。

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-10

`pcb beautify` 打磨(补丁):

### Added
- **多网美化**:`pcb beautify --net` 现在**可重复**——`--net USB_DP --net USB_DM`
  一次只美化这几个网(连接器新增 `nets: []string` payload)。密板上**首选按网做**
  而非整板一把梭:blast radius 小、每网可 dry-run + DRC 逐个验收、出问题好定位。

### Fixed
- **计数虚高**:`arcsCreated`/`linesCreated`/`cornersRounded` 之前在 DRC 二分修复
  的每一轮都累加,导致 `drcRounds>0` 时 summary 远大于最终几何(实测 4 拐角报 21 弧)。
  改为按路径记最终态、末尾汇总,数字现与落盘几何一致。

### Verified
- **连通性不被破坏**(控制实验,ceshi):对已知连通的多拐角网做 beautify,前后均为
  **单一连通分量、端点不变**(即使 DRC 修复把部分拐角退回直角)。据此判定此前 esp32
  真实板上 SD_* 的「断连」是那块 v0.2 板**原有**的未布通,非 beautify 切断。
  教训固化进 `references/pcb.md`:密板/未 DRC-clean 的板优先 `--net` 按网做、先测基线。

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-10

功能版本(minor):**PCB 走线美化 `easyeda pcb beautify` 上线**——吸收自开源扩展
[`m-RNA/Easy_EDA_PCB_Beautify`](https://github.com/m-RNA/Easy_EDA_PCB_Beautify)
(Apache-2.0),补齐布线定稿后的美化后处理档,接在 design-flow **P7.9**(P7 布线之后、
P8 铺铜/出 Gerber 之前)。

### Added
- **`easyeda pcb beautify` — 走线美化(拐角圆弧化)**:新 typed action `pcb.beautify`。
  把已布好的直角/锐角铜走线圆滑成圆弧(改善美观 + 可制造性,减少尖角蚀刻风险)。
  - `--scope all|selected`(默认 all)/ `--net` / `--layer` 过滤;`--selected` 只处理
    EasyEDA 里框选的走线。
  - **拐角圆弧化**:把同网同层相接的线段串成多段线,每个内拐角按 `--radius-ratio`
    (默认 3,半径=最大线宽×3)生成 fillet 圆弧,替换原线段为「截断直线 + 圆弧」。
  - **差分/等长同心圆弧**:成对/等长网的拐角走同心圆弧保护——feature-detect
    `pcb_Drc.getAllDifferentialPairs` / `getAllEqualLengthNetGroups`,该 build 无此 API
    时**降级为保直角**(不阻断)。`--no-protect` 关闭。
  - **自带安全网**:美化会 delete 原线段 + create line/arc,故内建 **DRC 二分修复**
    (`--drc-retry`,默认 4:缩半径或退回直角修违规拐角)+ **自动重铺覆铜**(同网 GND
    键合会 stale,复用 `pour-rebuild`)。`--no-drc` / `--no-pour-rebuild` 可关。
  - **`--dry-run`**:只计算规划(paths / lines / arcs)、**不动板**——可在任意真实板上
    安全预览。**只处理铜层,绝不碰丝印/板框**,跳过锁定铜。
  - 其它:`--force-arc`(线段太短也生成截断圆弧)、`--merge-u`(紧凑 U 型弯合并为
    单个大圆弧)。
- **几何库移植**:`extension/src/beautify/{math,arcGeometry,drc}.ts` 从上游纯几何
  verbatim 移植(无 eda.* 依赖),`index.ts` 为 headless 编排(去掉上游自研快照/撤销
  与 iframe 设置面板,改 payload 驱动、结果结构化返回)。
- **接入两个上游 DRC API**:`pcb_Drc.getAllDifferentialPairs` /
  `getAllEqualLengthNetGroups`(差分对/等长组读取)。

### Docs
- `references/design-flow.md` 新增 **P7.9 走线美化档**(dry-run 先行 + 上游告警清单:
  焊盘-走线连接需人工复核、RF/高速网排除全局美化、出 Gerber 前预览);
  `references/pcb.md` 加 `pcb beautify` 命令条目;`docs/ecosystem-survey.md` /
  `docs/reviews/2026-07-marketplace-coverage.md` absorb-list 标记已吸收(#1c)。
- **署名**:新增仓库根 `NOTICE`,记录 Apache-2.0 第三方来源、原作者 m-RNA、逐文件
  映射与相对上游的改动;几何文件头保留出处注释。

### Known limitations
- **线宽贝塞尔平滑**(上游 widthTransition)本版未移植——follow-up。
- 运行时已核:`pcb_PrimitiveArc.create` 在当前 web build **确认落笔提交**(ceshi 真机
  探针:create→getAll 命中→delete 净零还原,`err:null`);此前 `route-short --corner
  round` 的「native arc 不提交」笔记指的是 outline 的 MathPolygon 分段弧,与 primitive
  arc 无关。整链路端到端(路径链接/DRC 二分/重铺)首用建议仍在 ceshi 跑一遍确认。

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-10

功能版本(minor):**电路块库 `easyeda blocks` 上线**——从「器件→块→流程」三层
库的拓扑层落地为可离线查询的旗舰能力,配套 skill 自动同步、PCB 引脚级丝印批注、
整板批量落图脚本与切页竞态收口。

### Added
- **`easyeda blocks` — 离线电路块库查询(embedded)**:`ls` / `show <id>` /
  `search <query>`,块库 JSON 用 `go:embed` 编进二进制,**零 daemon / 零窗口 /
  零 skill 文件**——异地/裸机 `easyeda` 安装即可查已验证外设电路(CH340/自动下载/
  buck/RS485/CC1101/microSD…),不必下载 GitHub 库。skill 的 `references/blocks/*.json`
  仍是社区源(PR 进这里),`make sync-blocks` 构建前拷进 `internal/blocks/data/`
  再 embed;`internal/blocks` 带漂移守卫测试(embed 副本 ≠ skill 源即 CI 失败)。
  本次同时从 case001 提炼 4 新块入库(XL1509 buck / SP3485 RS485 / CC1101 巴伦 /
  microSD),再补最小系统 3 块(AMS1117 LDO 5→3.3 / BOOT+RESET 按键 / GPIO LED 指示),
  块库达 **10 ready**——esp32MiniRequire 最小系统已 100% 块覆盖(模组+CH340+自动下载+
  LDO+按键+LED)。
- **Skill 目录自动同步 + 连接器落后提示**(免手动升级):`daemon start` 默认带
  `--auto-update-skill`,启动时后台把已存在的 skill 目录(`~/.claude`、`~/.codex`)
  拉齐到最新 release 并逐步打日志(尊重 `EASYEDA_SKILL_PRESERVE`)。新增
  `easyeda skill status` / `easyeda skill sync`(`--version`/`--preserve`/`--client`/
  `--create-missing`/`--json`)手动查看与触发同一机制。连接器一注册即比对版本,落后
  时打**可操作日志**(重导 `.eext` + 彻底重启 EasyEDA)——sideload `.eext` 无原地
  自动更新(市场专属能力),故只检测+提示、不静默替换。install.sh 装完 skill 写
  `.version` 标记与 daemon 对齐避免重复下载。**连接器代码未变,升级无需重导 `.eext`。**

- **PCB 丝印批量标注**:`pcb silk-netnames`(`pcb.silk.netnames`)按矩形区域为网络
  名自动生成免碰撞丝印;`pcb silk-label-pads`(`pcb.silk.label_pads`)为器件焊盘按
  引脚号/网络名批量标注,支持 X/Y 轴贴齐(`--align-axis`)与朝向自动判定,便于给
  排针/连接器逐脚标功能。
- **`easyeda doc open <name|uuid>`**:`doc switch` 的语义化别名(open 一个文档),
  与 `doc ls`/`switch`/`reload` 风格一致。
- **整板批量落图脚本**:`scripts/bulk-place.py`(manifest→放置+位号回写)与
  `scripts/bulk-connect.py`(连接 spec→autoconnect+期望网表验证门+悬空脚修复循环),
  沉淀自 box-v2 139 件整板实测;`references/auto-layout-sop.md` 补 5 条实测经验
  (netport-first、引脚重合盲区、切页 settle 竞态、check 裸对象信封、验证门)。

### Fixed
- **切页竞态收口(#67)**:`document.open` / `schematic.page.open` 现在在返回前
  轮询活动页器件数直到 settle(连续两次相同即视为装载完成,`0 → N` 的装载中态
  不会被误判为空页),并在 result 中带 `ready:true/false`。修复「`doc switch`
  返回成功后立即 `sch check` 拿到空 findings、隔 2-4 秒才完整」的问题。PCB 无
  components 可轮询,乐观返回 `ready:true`。

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-08

自 0.8.3 以来的整体收口版本:PCB 布线/DRC 从「能放」走到「能连、能查、能救」,
原理图从零建图闭环幂等化,并沉淀了「抄官方板 → 自主设计」的训练方法论与
ADR-0002 前置设计交互。以下按主题汇总 0.8.4–0.8.13 各 dev 迭代的用户可见变化
(逐条明细见下方各历史条目)。

### Added
- **PCB 布线手术刀 + 换层跳线**:`pcb.route.delete`(按 primitiveId 精准删
  track/arc/via,rip_up 不再整网重铺)、`pcb.route.via_hop`(入口 stub→via→对层
  track→via→出口 stub 的复合换层,默认两层各放同网键合 fill 桥接 track↔via 裸结点)、
  `pcb.route.route_short` 多层布线(长/跨层 hop 用 via 换层,不再全推迷宫档)。
- **headless DRC 盲区补齐**:`pcb check` 新增通用间距规则(抓导线短接)、via-bond
  (ERROR:track↔via 裸结点未被键合 fill 覆盖)、floating-track-island、dangling-end
  (面积锚定)、缝合过孔间距、挖槽/过孔间距感知;`pcb drc` 支持 `--json`/`--timeout`
  + daemon 侧防重入。DRC 实测 66→31、Connection 9→0。
- **单网内电层**:同一 GND 网可独占内电层填充(via-stitch → pour)。
- **原理图分组与断连**:`sch group-move`(器件+周边 stub 导线/flag 刚性整体平移,
  无状态虚拟分组)、`schematic.pin.disconnect` 支持 `pinX`+`pinY` 坐标定位。
- **`sch autoplace-free`**:零区域自动布局,把件塞进纸面空白处。
- 标准器件库扩充:芯片级设计 11 件 + case001 通用料 24 件(`references/standard-parts.json`)。
- `pcb.silk.label_pads` 新增 `alignAxis` / `--align-axis` 参数:可选择按 X 轴或 Y
  轴贴齐标注(`x`/`y`/`auto`),并在结果中返回 `align_axis_chosen`。适合排针/连接器
  等不同朝向封装,让丝印标注沿焊盘阵列形成整齐队列。

### Changed
- **`sch autoconnect` 幂等化(issue #50)**:`components.list --include-pins` 的每个
  pin 附带权威网表来源的 `net` 字段,autoconnect 据此三态判定 pin 是否已连目标网,
  重跑不再叠加 flag。
- **Skill 方法论沉淀**:ADR-0002 前置设计方案书(S0)+ 三档交互模式(决策交互化、
  执行自动化);紧凑布局设为默认 + 手工修线三律;官方板对标 §7.8–7.9 地策略选择判据
  (单 GND→双 PLANE;多地域→全 SIGNAL 分区 pour);抄图训练闭环(XDS110 174/174 pin
  一致 + 多页拆分)固化为验收方法。

### Fixed
- **`sch page.rename` 写后自校验(issue #55)**:改名后 `doc ls` 读到旧页名 → 短间隔
  重试读回确认,命中 `verified:true`,超时如实返回 `verified:false`+warning。
- **`--all-pages` 非激活页壳数据告警(issue #54)**:`sch read/list/check/layout-lint`
  对非激活页如实警告 pins/bbox 可能为空,`layout-lint` 把 skip 升为醒目 WARN。
- **`sch check` geom-net-mismatch 对 netflag/netport 静音**:designator 为空的原语
  网表交叉校验静音,几何单独判(64/64 误报→0)。
- **`sch autolayout` 锚点 snap 到 5 网格**:分区居中产出的分数坐标(206.25)不再致
  connect_pin 批量失败;`connect_pin` 引脚离网格时快速失败给可行动报错。
- **lib search 对 LCSC C 号精确匹配**:不再模糊命中错料。

## [0.8.9] - 2026-07-07

闭环优化 B/P0 收尾:布线手术刀 + 换层跳线复合动作(封 pro-api-sdk#31 track↔via
不导通坑)。配套 daemon 侧 DRC 防重入 + 超时预算传导(CLI `pcb drc --json/--timeout`)。

### Added
- `pcb.route.delete` — 按 primitiveId 精准删 track/arc/via(rip_up 是整网粒度,
  一颗错 via 不再重铺全网)。`kind` 守卫拒绝贴错类别的 id;锁定跳过、陈旧 id 报
  `notFound`;`removed[]` 回显每个被删图元的完整 before-state(net/layer/几何),
  audit log 足以重建。
- `pcb.route.via_hop` — 复合换层跳线:入口 stub → via → 对层 track → via → 出口
  stub,**默认在两颗 via 的两层各放一片同网键合 fill**(4 层/曾有 PLANE 板上裸
  track↔via 结点不注册导通,fill 面重叠是唯一可靠桥接)。via 距端点 `stub`(默认
  20mil)防压焊盘;中途失败整体回滚。

## [0.8.8] - 2026-07-07

插件市场审核修复（承接 0.8.4–0.8.7 的图片系列问题，最终定案）。逐个把关卡打通：
(1) 0.8.3 外链 jsDelivr → 判"README 图片未显示"；改成打进包。
(2) 写 `./images/…`（带 `./`）→ 上传弹"图片未通过审核"；对拆 4 个高装机成功插件
    发现它们一律写 `images/xxx`（无 `./`），去掉 `./`。
(3) 仍被服务端错误码 `101019`（"图片未通过审核"，英文 "Image failed moderation"）
    拦。**直接打平台 `/api/v1/images/upload` 逐张实测**：`logo.jpg`、
    `demo-pcb-layout.gif`、`demo-esp32-board.png` 全过；唯独
    `demo-schematic-generation.gif` 恒返回 101019（鉴审 GIF 解码路径异常，非内容
    违规——其静态帧 PNG 实测过审）。**故把这张动图换成静态 PNG（完整原理图那一帧）**。
最终演示图集：原理图静态 PNG + PCB 布局 GIF（保留一张会动的）+ ESP32 成品板 PNG，
全部经 `/api/v1/images/upload` 实测过审。纯市场展示层，连接器代码无变化，无需重连/重启。

### Fixed
- 市场错误码 101019“上传的图片未通过审核”：`demo-schematic-generation.gif`
  的动图被鉴审解码器判异常 → 换为同内容的静态 PNG（已逐张实测过审）。
- （承接）README 图片路径去掉 `./` 前缀，写 `images/…`，对齐成功插件一致写法。

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-06

Typed PCB layer/view switching for bottom-side visual QA (#40) + release-flow
ClawHub integration. Connector code changed (`extension/src/actions.ts`) — this
release **requires a connector re-import** (uninstall old → import new .eext →
fully quit & relaunch EasyEDA). Version 0.8.2 is skipped: it was burned on
ClawHub by a stale-content skill upload (clawhub workdir trap; versions are
immutable there), so 0.8.3 keeps CLI/connector/skill aligned.

### Added
- **Typed PCB layer/view actions** (no more manual UI clicks for bottom-side
  checks): `pcb.layers.set_current` (`pcb layer-set`, accepts
  id|name|top|bottom|inner1), `pcb.layers.visibility` (`pcb layer-visibility`,
  presets top-only|bottom-only|copper-only|silk-only or explicit show/hide),
  `pcb.view.side` (`pcb view-side`) — selects the side's copper and focuses its
  copper/silk layers so the next snapshot reflects that side. No native canvas
  flip API exists, so view-side is a layer-focus approximation, not a physical
  board flip.
- **`make release` now publishes the skill to ClawHub** at the same version
  (best-effort — a hub failure doesn't block the release; retry with
  `make publish-skill VERSION=…`). Uses an absolute path to dodge the clawhub
  global-workdir trap.

### Fixed
- **`currentLayer:null` readback (#40)** — `pcb.layers.list` now activates the
  PCB tab before `getCurrentLayer` and returns `visibleLayers` as display-state
  evidence when `currentLayer` is empty.
- **README install commands** — removed the non-working skillhub.cn CLI command
  (web-only community, no `/api/cli/v1` endpoint); ClawHub + GitHub Release
  `skills.tar.gz` are the supported skill-install paths.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-04

Fresh-PCB pour-reflow fix, solidified end to end (root cause pinned → commands →
playbook → fresh-board replay-verified: DRC 55 → 1). Go/CLI only — no connector
code change, no re-import needed.

**Root cause pinned**: a PCB document created in the current session and never
reloaded computes pour reflow from a **creation-time rules snapshot** — rule
writes (readback shows them), `pour-rebuild`, and tab-switching have NO effect
until the document is really closed and reopened; already-reloaded documents
honor rule writes immediately. On top of that, the fresh-board reflow runs ~3%
under the configured clearance (10mil → ~9.7mil) and skips thermal spokes
(suspected platform issue, to be reported upstream).

### Added
- **`easyeda doc reload [name|uuid]`** — save + close + reopen a document (a
  real reload; `doc switch` only changes the foreground tab). Refreshes the
  per-document reflow rules snapshot; run `pcb pour-rebuild` after reloading a
  PCB. Saves first (typed `schematic.save`/`pcb.save` by document type), so no
  edits are lost.
- **`easyeda pcb drc-rules-set --pour-clearance <mil>`** — the write side of
  `drc-rules` (v1 knob: pour/plane copper clearance, **raise-only** — never
  loosens a stricter board). Patches `Plane` `lineClearance` (copperRegion both
  pad models + innerPlane) of the current rule configuration, writes it back
  (bare-config API shape — the `{name, config}` wrapper silently no-ops),
  verifies by re-read; a write on a system preset turns it into a per-board
  自定义配置 copy, as the platform requires.
- **esp32-mini playbook: `rules-pour-margin` + `reload-pcb` + `pour-rebuild-2`
  steps** (182→186) — margin 10→12mil before pouring, then a document reload +
  second rebuild after, so a replay on a **freshly created PCB** passes DRC
  directly. Verified end to end on a fresh board (ceshi/Board4): 47 + 186 steps
  green, official DRC = 1 (the known #33 add-component netlist false positive).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-03

Recording/demo-mode reliability — a one-call **stage capture** that gates on the
frame, plus **blank-frame detection** — and a **netless-pour** cleanup, on top of
the accumulated connector fixes.

### Added
- **`easyeda pcb stage-snapshot --stage "…"`** — one-call recording/demo STAGE
  capture: native PCB snapshot + a data bundle (components/tracks/vias/pours/nets/drc)
  + a `stage.json` manifest, **GATED on the frame** — a BLANK / STALE / wrong-document
  (foreground tab not a PCB) capture exits non-zero, so a `set -e` recording script
  halts instead of banking a bad frame. Go/CLI only, no re-import.
- **Blank-frame detection on `pcb/sch snapshot`.** The capture reads the FOREGROUND
  tab's rendered canvas, which comes back BLANK when the window isn't visibly rendering
  (minimized / backgrounded). The CLI decodes the PNG and WARNs on a blank frame —
  distinct from a STALE (byte-identical) one. Verified: no API call (view fit / zoom /
  ratline / openDocument / tab-switch) repaints a hidden window; the only fix is
  bringing EasyEDA to the foreground. Go/CLI only.
- **`easyeda pcb pour-clean --netless [--dry-run]`** — remove copper pours bound to
  no net (dead copper that `pour-fit --replace` can't clear — it only matches same-net
  pours). Surfaced by the new `pcb check` **netless-pour** rule. Go/CLI only. (#34)
- **`easyeda debug exec --timeout <sec>`** — override the 20s round-trip default for
  slow eda.* calls (e.g. `sch_Netlist.getNetlist()`, which can loop >90s on a schematic
  with floating pins — prefer `getNetlistFile()`, which `sch read` uses and never hangs).
  Go/CLI only, no re-import.

### Fixed
- **`connect_pin`/`sch autoconnect` now actually FORM the net (grid-snap fix).** The stub
  endpoint (grid-aligned pin + a non-grid offset like 18 → 338) landed off the 10-unit
  schematic grid, but a created netflag/netport SNAPS to the nearest grid point (340) — so
  the stub ended a grid-step short of the flag's connection pin, the flag floated
  unconnected, its net NAME never applied, and same-named flags NEVER merged (every pin
  became its own auto-named 1-pin net `$1N…`). connect_pin now snaps its stub endpoint to
  the grid so it coincides with the snapped flag pin. Verified: two `--net MERGE` netports
  now read back as one net `MERGE deg 2 [R1.2, R2.1]` (was two `$1N` singletons). Unblocks
  building a netlisted schematic from scratch via the API. (Re-import needed.)
- **`pcb.pour.create` refuses a netless pour.** An empty/absent `net` used to be
  silently coerced to `''`, creating dead copper (a net:"" pour) that `pour-fit
  --replace` can't clear — the #34 confusion. It now errors `net is required`. The CLI
  (`pcb pour` / `pour-fit`) already fails fast; this is the connector-side backstop for
  raw `debug.exec_js` / other callers. (Takes effect after re-importing the connector.)
- **`pcb new-board` no longer silently steals the schematic.** A schematic can belong
  to only ONE Board in EasyEDA Pro, so `createBoard(schematicUuid)` on an already-bound
  schematic *moves* it into the new board — leaving the old board with just its PCB
  ("原理图没了"). `board.new_pcb` now detects an already-bound schematic and refuses with
  a clear error naming the owning board; pass `--force` (`force: true`) to move it
  deliberately.
- **`board list` / `pcb board-info` no longer crash on a PCB-only or schematic-only
  Board.** `serializeBoard` read `board.schematic.uuid` / `board.pcb.uuid`
  unconditionally, throwing `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'uuid')` for
  any board missing one side (exactly the orphaned boards the old `new-board` produced).
  It now emits `null` for the missing side.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-02

The market-ready PCB pass since v0.6.0 — a reconstructed **PCB DFM audit** (`pcb check`),
a full **silkscreen suite**, the verified **4-layer inner-plane** recipe, and a reconnect
UX fix. (Consolidates the dev-loop releases 0.6.1–0.6.7 below.)

### Added
- **`pcb check` — reconstructed DFM audit** (the PCB sibling of `sch check`; catches the
  design-for-manufacture problems the native `pcb drc` clearance check does NOT flag).
  Copper rules compute purely Go-side from placed copper and never mutate:
  **dangling-end** (a track end anchored to nothing → floating copper), **acute-angle**
  (same-net segments bending <90° → acid trap), **non-orthogonal** (a track off the
  0/45/90° grid → free-angle routing), **track-over-pad** (a track crossing a pad it
  doesn't terminate on: cross-net = ERROR short), **overlapping-via** / **single-layer-via**,
  **width-mismatch**, **duplicate-segment**, and **3W parallel-coupling**; plus
  **silkscreen-flipped** (a designator on the wrong silk layer / mirrored / non-upright)
  and per-layer **antenna-keepout** (an antenna module lacking a no-copper keep-out on
  every copper layer). `--strict` exits non-zero on any WARN/ERROR (gate-able).
- **Silkscreen suite** — `pcb silk-add` (a FREE silkscreen string: board credit / LED
  `+`/`−` polarity marks; configurable layer/font/stroke/rotation, JLCPCB-legible
  defaults), `pcb silk-set` (batch-adjust existing silk + an **align-to-reference**
  shortcut: center a board credit, align a label to a component/board/fill edge), and the
  read handlers `pcb.silk.list` (text layer/mirror/reverse/rotation) + `pcb.region.list`
  bbox that feed the DFM checks.
- **`easyeda pcb new-board` (`board.new_pcb`)** — create a brand-new board (板) with a
  fresh EMPTY PCB page bound to a schematic (CLI equivalent of the UI 新建PCB /
  原理图转PCB), then `pcb import-changes` to lay it out from scratch. Distinct from
  `board.create` (link-only). Runs the required 2-step SDK sequence that is otherwise a
  silent no-op — `createBoard(schematicUuid)` mints a board shell, then
  `createPcb(boardName)` adds the PCB INTO it — with shell rollback on failure.
  `--schematic` defaults to the current board's schematic.
- **`easyeda notify` (`system.notify`)** — show a non-blocking toast INSIDE the EasyEDA
  window so the design flow can announce each stage live ("完成 布线,下一步 铺铜").
  `--type info|success|warn|error|question`, `--duration`.

### Changed
- **`pcb silk-align` → position-aware (v2)** — ranks each designator's 4 sides by local
  free space + board position + a crowd-axis bonus, and avoids **other parts' pads**,
  bodies, keep-out regions, the board outline (now resolves rounded/polyline outlines),
  and other labels; keeps assembly clearance around each footprint (`--spacing`); a
  boxed-in part is reported (`unresolved`), never shoved onto a pad.
- **`pcb power-planes` flips the GND inner layer to 内电层/PLANE** after pouring (verified
  pour-while-SIGNAL → flip-type → rebuild recipe, DRC clean), matching the common customer
  stackup GND=内电层 / VCC=信号层. Drove the ESP32 regression board DRC 31→0, No-Connection→0.
- **`pcb auto-place --assembly-gap` (default 40 mil)** floors the chip-to-satellite gap at a
  hand-SOLDER clearance, not just the DRC routing clearance (~28 mil packed too tight to
  reach with an iron). **`pcb check` antenna-keepout now recognizes a single MULTI-layer(12)
  region** as covering every copper layer — one 多层 keep-out replaces the per-layer set.
  design-flow.md PCB pipeline reordered so keep-out regions + silk-align run BEFORE routing
  (post-hoc keep-outs forced re-routing).

### Fixed
- **Reconnect toast dedup** — one toast per daemon outage instead of one on every 3s retry
  (they were stacking and covering UI options during an outage).

### Docs
- README split into a Chinese homepage (`README.md`) + English (`README.en.md`); new demo
  recording storyboard `docs/demo-storyboard-esp32-mini.md`; FEATURES action count 85→88;
  official-marketplace coverage survey (`docs/reviews/2026-07-marketplace-coverage.md`).

## [0.6.7] - 2026-07-02
### Fixed
- **silk-align: labels no longer crowd their OWN pads** — the body used for the offset
  is inflated by an assembly-clearance floor (Cassembly=10 mil) and own-pad overlap now
  carries a penalty, so a designator keeps solder-iron room around its footprint instead
  of touching the copper. New **`spacing`** coefficient (default 1.5, `--spacing`) scales
  the label drift for more/less assembly room; base offset default 12→15; other-pad
  margin Cpad 8→12.
- **`--ref board`/`outline` now resolves rounded/closed outlines** — the board outline is
  often a single `pcb_PrimitivePolyline` on layer 11, which the Line/Arc-only resolver
  missed (silk-set align + silk-align safeArea both use the new shared `boardOutlineIds`).

## [0.6.6] - 2026-07-02
### Changed
- **`pcb.silk.align` is now POSITION-AWARE** (designed via a 3-lens workflow). It ranks
  each designator's 4 sides by local free space + board position (edge parts pulled
  inward, never off-board) + a crowd-axis bonus (dense stacks pushed perpendicular),
  and — the core fix — avoids **other parts' PADS** (a label over exposed copper is
  fab-clipped; this is why C1's designator no longer lands on C2's pad), bodies,
  keep-out regions, the board outline, and other labels. Most-constrained-first order;
  bottom parts → bottom silk + mirror; a boxed-in part is left + reported (unresolved)
  rather than moved onto a pad. New outputs: warned / unresolved.
### Added
- **`pcb.silk.set` gains an ALIGN shortcut** — `align` (center|mid|centerx|centery|
  left|right|top|bottom) + `ref` (a component designator, "board"/"outline", or "fill")
  positions each silk relative to that reference bbox (e.g. center the board credit,
  align a label to a component edge), computed from the silk's own bbox.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-07-02
### Fixed
- **Reconnect toast spam / UI obscuring.** During a daemon outage the connector
  toasted "Daemon not found, retrying (n/5)" on EVERY fast retry (every 3s), so the
  toasts stacked and covered UI options ("one starts before the last ends"). Now it
  toasts **once per outage** (on the first failed scan) and retries **silently** in
  the background; the retry cadence (fast 3s → slow 10s) and reconnect speed are
  unchanged, and the eventual reconnect still announces once.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-07-02
### Added
- **`pcb.silk.add`** — create a FREE silkscreen STRING (board marking / credit / note)
  at (x,y) with config: layer (3=top / 4=bottom), fontSize, lineWidth, rotation.
  Legible JLCPCB-safe defaults (font 40 / stroke 6) — a small font with a thick stroke
  smears the glyphs. Returns primitiveId + rendered bbox.
- **`pcb.silk.set`** — batch-reconfigure existing silkscreen primitives (designator/
  value ATTRIBUTES + free STRINGS): primitiveIds[] + any of x/y/rotation/fontSize/
  lineWidth/text; only the given keys change. Uses the reliable `.modify(id,props)`
  (setState_Rotation alone does NOT persist). The batch position/orientation/size fixer
  behind correcting badly-placed or non-upright silk.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-02
### Changed
- **`pcb.region.list`** now emits each region's **`bbox`** (`getPrimitivesBBox`), so
  the daemon's new `pcb check` **antenna-keepout** rule can test whether a no-copper
  keep-out region actually overlaps an antenna module's footprint. Rule types are
  already reported, so the check reads no-copper = any of no-wires/no-fills/no-pours/
  no-inner-electrical.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-02
### Changed
- **`pcb.silk.list`** now also emits each text's **`reverse`** (`getState_Reverse` —
  left/right reversed reading) and **`rotation`** (`getState_Rotation`, degrees).
  `getState_Mirror` alone missed real "放反" cases: a designator rotated 180°
  (upside-down) or 90/270° (sideways) has `mirror=false` but doesn't read upright.
  The daemon's `pcb check` **silkscreen-flipped** rule now flags a reference
  designator (`key == "Designator"`) whose orientation isn't upright, and treats
  `mirror OR reverse` as "reads backwards". (`getState_HorizonMirror` does not exist
  on text primitives — confirmed via runtime probe.)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-02
### Added
- **`pcb.silk.list`** — read-only enumeration of every SILKSCREEN TEXT primitive:
  component designator/value ATTRIBUTES (`pcb_PrimitiveAttribute`) plus free STRINGS
  (`pcb_PrimitiveString`), each with its silk layer (3=TOP_SILKSCREEN /
  4=BOTTOM_SILKSCREEN), mirror flag, text, position, and (for attributes) the parent
  component's id + side (TOP/BOTTOM). Feeds the daemon's `pcb check`
  **silkscreen-flipped** rule — top silk must read un-mirrored, bottom silk must be
  mirrored, and a designator's silk side must match its component's side; a mismatch
  is a flipped/back-side silkscreen (丝印放反). The PCB component primitive itself has
  no `getState_Mirror`, so orientation is read from the text primitives, not the
  component.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-01
> PCB automation milestone (tasks #21–#32). Connector-side changes below; the bulk
> of the release is DAEMON-side (Go CLI) PCB automation, summarized under "Daemon".
### Added
- **`pcb.silk.align`** (task #30) — reposition each component's DESIGNATOR silkscreen
  with COLLISION AVOIDANCE: searches candidate slots around each footprint (preferred
  `side` first, then other directions at increasing distance) and takes the first that
  hits no other component body and no already-placed label — dense-cluster designators
  get pushed into open space instead of piling up. The designator is a component-bound
  attribute (pcb_PrimitiveString is empty), repositioned via
  `pcb_PrimitiveAttribute.getAllPrimitiveId(componentId)` + `.modify(id,{x,y})`.
  Reports `unresolvedCollisions`. CLI: `pcb silk-align`.
- **`pcb.stackup.set`** (task #26) — configure the board stackup: set the copper
  layer count (2/4/6/…/32 via `setTheNumberOfCopperLayers`) and/or set inner layers'
  type SIGNAL↔PLANE (内电层, via `modifyLayer`). A PLANE inner layer gives GND/power
  a dedicated plane on 4+ layer boards — the clean fix for the 2-layer pour conflict
  where two power nets can't both connect on one shared layer. Read via
  `pcb.layers.list`. CLI: `pcb stackup set --layers 4 --plane 15 --plane 16`.

### Fixed
- **Connector auto-reconnect wedge (需要重开窗口才恢复)** — after a daemon restart
  (dev hot-reload) or a long window-backgrounding, `isConnecting` could leak `true`
  and freeze EVERY reconnect path at once: the watchdog tick, the port scan, AND the
  focus/online/visibility wake listeners all early-returned on `isConnecting`, so
  only fully reopening the EasyEDA window recovered. Now (1) the watchdog
  force-resets a connect flow still unsettled after ~24s (`STUCK_CONNECTING_TICKS`),
  and (2) the foreground/online wake forces a clean reconnect *through* a stuck
  `isConnecting` (`cancelConnectionFlow()` first) instead of being blocked by it.

### Daemon (CLI) — PCB automation pass
All real-machine verified on the ESP32 regression board; each `easyeda pcb …` subcommand:
- **Rule-aware** `route-short` / `auto-place` / `pour` — read the board's live DRC rule
  (`pcb drc-rules`) and conform (widths/clearance/via/copper-to-edge) instead of hardcoding;
  fall back to a canonical **JLCPCB fab-rule reference** (real per-board-type exports). (#22/#32)
- `route-short` **v2**: obstacle-aware L-orientation, and **skips power/ground nets** by
  default (they belong in a pour — routing 3V3 as thin tracks was the #1 DRC source). (#23)
- `pcb outline-fit` (tighten to parts) / `pcb outline-round` (rounded-rect outline). (#21/#29)
- `pcb layout-lint` — placement quality + **routability score** (ratsnest MST + crossings). (#25)
- `pcb power-planes` — **4-layer** power distribution: GND + power on dedicated inner planes
  + via-stitch each pad (drove the regression board's No-Connection to 0). (#26)
- `pcb region` / `fill` / `slot` — antenna keep-out (禁铺铜) & board cutout (挖槽). (#28)
- Confirmed platform walls (no `eda.*` API): teardrops, controlled-impedance, interactive routing.

## [0.5.30] - 2026-06-30
### Added
- **`pcb.add_component`** (task #20) — add ONE part to an EXISTING PCB and wire it,
  the working alternative to `pcb.import_changes` (which is a no-op for API-added
  parts). Places the footprint (`pcb_PrimitiveComponent.create`), links it to its
  schematic twin (uniqueId + designator), assigns each pad's net from a caller-
  supplied `nets` map (`pcb_PrimitivePad.modify` — the step that actually wires it,
  since net→pad assignment is otherwise part of the broken import flow), and
  recomputes ratlines. CLI: `easyeda pcb add-component`. `schematic.read` now also
  returns each component's `uniqueId` (the sch↔PCB link key to pass in).
### Investigated
- `eda.pcb_Document.importChanges` does NOT sync API-added components to an existing
  PCB (returns true, count unchanged) — root-caused to incremental-add being a
  platform no-op; superseded by `pcb.add_component`.

## [0.5.29] - 2026-06-30
### Added
- **One-call circuit snapshot** (task #7): `schematic.read` returns a coherent
  semantic model in a single round-trip — components (each pin tagged with its
  JSON-authoritative net from `getNetlistFile`), nets (net → connected pins +
  degree + power/ground flag), floating pins, and the geometric design check
  (`includeCheck:false` to skip). Replaces the agent stitching `components.list` +
  `netlist` + `check`. CLI: `easyeda sch read` (`--all-pages`, `--no-check`).

## [0.5.28] - 2026-06-30
### Fixed
- **Auto-reconnect no longer needs a window "nudge".** The heartbeat/reconnect loop
  ran on a main-thread `setInterval`, which EasyEDA's webview freezes when the
  window is backgrounded — so after a daemon restart (e.g. `make dev` rebuild) the
  connector stayed dead until the user focused the window. A new **watchdog** drives
  both the heartbeat and reconnect from a **Web Worker** timer (which keeps firing
  while backgrounded); it falls back to a main-thread interval + `focus`/`online`
  listeners if the webview blocks workers. An explicit Stop now sets a `suspended`
  flag so the always-on watchdog doesn't reconnect behind the user's back.

## [0.5.27] - 2026-06-30
### Added
- **Net-bound filled region** (task #17): `pcb.fill.create` / `pcb.fill.list` /
  `pcb.fill.delete` (`eda.pcb_PrimitiveFill.*`) — a STATIC filled polygon bound to a
  net (3V3/RF-ground patch, thermal copper, odd-shaped plane). `fillMode = solid
  (default) | mesh | inner`. Distinct from `pcb.pour.create` (覆铜, reflows around
  obstacles) and `pcb.region.create` (keep-out, no net). CLI: `easyeda pcb fill
  create / list / delete`.

## [0.5.26] - 2026-06-30
### Added
- **DSN keep-out injection** (task #17): `pcb.export.dsn` now splices keep-out
  regions (禁止区域) back into the exported DSN by default — `getDsnFile` DROPS
  `pcb_PrimitiveRegion`, so a raw export had `keepout = 0` and Freerouting would
  route under the antenna. Each routing region (no-wires/no-fills/no-pours) becomes
  a Specctra `(keepout (polygon …))` in the `(structure)` section. Transform is a
  verified pure translation (1:1 mil, no flip; offset = DSN-boundary-min −
  outline-bbox-min). Result reports `keepouts = N`. CLI `easyeda pcb export-dsn`
  gains `--raw` for the unmodified export.

## [0.5.25] - 2026-06-30
### Added
- **PCB keep-out / rule regions** (task #11): `pcb.region.create` / `pcb.region.list`
  / `pcb.region.delete` (`eda.pcb_PrimitiveRegion.*`). A polygon carrying rule types
  — `no-components(2)` / `no-wires(5)` / `no-fills(6)` / `no-pours(7)` /
  `no-inner-electrical(8)` / `follow-rule(9)`; default is a hard keep-out
  `[no-components, no-wires, no-pours]` for antenna clearance / board-edge inset.
  NOT net-bound filled copper (that's `pcb.pour.create`). CLI: `easyeda pcb region
  create / list / delete`. (DSN keep-out injection for the Freerouting maze tier is a
  separate follow-up — `getDsnFile` drops regions.)

## [0.5.24] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- **Freerouting round-trip building blocks** (task #5): `pcb.export.dsn`
  (`getDsnFile` → Specctra DSN artifact, the autorouter input), `pcb.import_autoroute`
  (`importAutoRouteSesFile`/`importAutoRouteJsonFile`, base64 in, recomputes ratlines),
  and `pcb.snapshot` (`getCurrentRenderedAreaImage` for the PCB canvas — the PCB
  counterpart to `schematic.snapshot`). Enables the file-based autoroute workflow
  `pcb export-dsn` → run Freerouting → `pcb import-autoroute route.ses` without the
  @alpha `autoRouting()`. CLI: `easyeda pcb export-dsn / import-autoroute / snapshot`.

## [0.5.23] - 2026-06-29
### Added
- `schematic.check` now reports **stray wires** the SDK DRC and layout-lint both
  miss: `dangling-wire` (a segment whose vertices touch no pin, net-flag/port/label,
  or other wire — e.g. a stub left behind when its pin/flag was deleted) and
  `zero-length-wire`. Each finding carries the `wirePrimitiveId` so it can be
  removed with `sch prim-delete`. Summary gains `zeroLengthWires` / `danglingWires`.

## [0.5.22] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- Net-flag/net-port **vertical (up/down) body orientation** on the y-DOWN build:
  `connect_pin --direction down` ground (and `--direction up` power) flags rendered
  their body toward the pin instead of away. Root cause was the orientation table's
  up/down entries being derived in a y-UP frame; `ROTATION_CYCLE` is now
  `up→right→down→left` with power/ground anchors swapped (left/right unchanged).
  Verified via `getPrimitivesBBox` on real placed flags + `calibrate.js` (whose own
  y-frame was fixed). See `orientation.json` _doc.

## [0.5.20] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- `schematic.drc.check` now treats boolean SDK results as first-class normalized
  output instead of assuming the verbose overload always returns an array. This
  matches current EasyEDA runtime behavior for `SCH_Drc.check`.
- `schematic.check` now reconstructs additional UI-like warnings for schematic
  validation: net-marker/wire-name mismatches and multi-net wires.
- Floating-pin detection now cross-checks the official manufacture netlist JSON
  (`sch_ManufactureData.getNetlistFile`) before reporting a pin as floating.
- Net-marker checks now dedupe repeated wire/marker segment matches and only treat
  a marker as attached when it touches a wire vertex, reducing false positives from
  malformed merged polylines.

### Changed
- CLI and skill docs now distinguish the official SDK DRC gate (`sch drc`) from
  the reconstructed per-item checker (`sch check`).

## [0.5.18] - 2026-06-28
### Added
- **PCB routing roadmap R1 (copper pour) + R2 (rip-up/list)** from
  `docs/ecosystem-survey.md §7` — 8 new actions, d.ts-grounded + adversarially reviewed:
  - `pcb.pour.create` / `pcb.pour.list` / `pcb.pour.delete` / `pcb.pour.rebuild` —
    **copper pour (铺铜)**. create takes raw `points`; the connector builds the
    `IPCB_Polygon` via `pcb_MathPolygon.createPolygon` (the missing piece behind the old
    "无法创建覆铜边框图元" failures — you must pass a polygon object, not raw points),
    then `rebuildCopperRegion()` computes the fill. `fill = solid|grid|grid45`. CLI
    `easyeda pcb pour / pour-list / pour-delete / pour-rebuild`.
  - `pcb.route.rip_up` — **reliable rip-up** (getAll → filter → delete on stable
    primitive APIs, the official kirouting pattern). Deletes tracks+arcs+vias on
    **copper layers only** (TOP/BOTTOM/INNER) — never the board outline,
    silkscreen/assembly/mechanical artwork, or **locked** primitives. `--net` scopes;
    omit = all. CLI `easyeda pcb rip-up`.
  - `pcb.line.list` / `pcb.via.list` — read routed tracks/vias. CLI `pcb track-list` /
    `pcb via-list`.
  - `pcb.clear_routing` — wraps native `clearRouting` (`@alpha`, may be undefined;
    prefer `pcb.route.rip_up`). CLI `easyeda pcb clear-routing`.
  - Smart/interactive routing (single/multi/diff routing, stretch, optimize,
    length-tuning, fanout) has NO `eda.*` API — documented as a hard boundary (§7).
- **Five actions absorbed from the official open-source extension ecosystem**
  (see `docs/ecosystem-survey.md`), each grounded in `pro-api-types` signatures:
  - `schematic.library.get_by_lcsc` — resolve LCSC C-numbers directly to
    `{libraryUuid, uuid}` via `eda.lib_Device.getByLcscIds` (deterministic, no
    free-text ranking; reports `notFound`). CLI `easyeda lib by-lcsc --lcsc C…`.
  - `pcb.line.create` — create a copper track via `eda.pcb_PrimitiveLine.create`
    (mutating). CLI `easyeda pcb track`.
  - `pcb.via.create` — place a via via `eda.pcb_PrimitiveVia.create` (mutating).
    CLI `easyeda pcb via`.
  - `pcb.report` — read-only design report (per-net length, net-class totals,
    differential-pair skew, equal-length spread) over `eda.pcb_Net.getNetLength` +
    `eda.pcb_Drc.getAll{NetClasses,DifferentialPairs,EqualLengthNetGroups}`. CLI
    `easyeda pcb report`.
  - `pcb.drc.rules` — read `eda.pcb_Drc.getCurrentRuleConfiguration` without
    running a check. CLI `easyeda pcb drc-rules`.
  - **Live-verified on a real board (PCB1, connector 0.5.15):** A1 resolves
    C6186→AMS1117-3.3 identity; A5 returns the full rule config; A3 reports 4 nets
    with length/net-class/diff/equal-length; A2 creates a GND track (net length
    read back 0→500, confirming it bound to the right net); `pcb drc` + save pass.
- **`pcb.save` — save the active PCB to disk** (`eda.pcb_Document.save`), the PCB
  counterpart to `schematic.save`. CLI `easyeda pcb save`. **PCB autosave is now
  on:** the daemon's debounced autosave fires `pcb.save` after a PCB-mutating
  action, closing the in-memory-edit data-loss gap that previously only schematic
  edits were protected from (`saveActionForDocType` now maps `pcb`→`pcb.save`).

### Fixed
- **`pcb.outline.set` now creates the REAL board-outline object (类型=板框), not loose
  lines.** Root cause of "the outline vanished when I cleared routing" + "DRC doesn't
  flag out-of-board": the outline was drawn as N separate `pcb_PrimitiveLine`s on
  layer 11. A loose line on the board-outline layer is just a wire that happens to sit
  there — EasyEDA does NOT treat it as the board boundary (DRC ignores it for
  enclosure, the UI "清除布线 / clear routing" deletes it). Compared a UI-drawn 板框
  against ours: the real outline is ONE `pcb_PrimitivePolyline` whose `polygon` is an
  `IPCB_Polygon`. Fix: build the closed-polygon source `[x0,y0,'L',…,x0,y0]` →
  `eda.pcb_MathPolygon.createPolygon` → `eda.pcb_PrimitivePolyline.create('', 11,
  polygon, lineWidth, /*lock*/true)` — one locked polyline. `pcb.outline.get/clear`
  updated to read/delete the polyline (bbox from its rendered extent; legacy lines
  still handled). Default lineWidth 10mil. Returns `outlineId`. Create flow verified
  live (createPolygon + polyline produced a 类型=板框 object matching the UI's).
- **`view region` + `schematic.snapshot --no-fit` now reliably captures the
  requested local region (issue #20).** Three coordinated fixes: (1) the snapshot
  handler now waits for the canvas to repaint (two `requestAnimationFrame`s with a
  timeout fallback) BEFORE reading the frame, so a preceding `view region` viewport
  has actually landed — previously `--no-fit` grabbed the pre-region frame because
  EasyEDA does not synchronously repaint after `eda.*` view calls (the `--fit` path
  only "worked" by accident, since `zoomToAllPrimitives` nudged a redraw). (2)
  Built-in stale-frame detection: the snapshot result now exposes the frame
  `sha256`; thread it back via `sch snapshot --previous-sha256 <sha>` and the
  connector detects a byte-identical (stale) frame, retries once after another
  redraw, and reports `stale`/`staleRetry`. (3) `view.region` now normalizes the
  rectangle (sorts each axis to min/max) and rejects a zero-area box, so a
  reversed/degenerate bound no longer renders as a tiny sliver in a blank frame;
  `view region` CLI help documents the y-DOWN schematic axis semantics and units.
- **`schematic.power.connect_pin` (`sch connect`) `--direction up/down` no longer
  inverts the stub/netport endpoint.** EasyEDA Pro schematic coords are y-DOWN (a
  larger stored y renders LOWER on screen, verified on 3.2.121, issue #19), but the
  endpoint math assumed y-UP, so `--direction up` pushed a top-pin stub DOWN into the
  IC body and `--direction down` pushed a bottom-pin stub UP — visually wrong even
  when DRC was clean. `up` now decreases y (visually higher) and `down` increases y
  (visually lower). The flag-rotation table is unchanged: it is calibrated against
  real rendered bbox and already keyed to visual directions, so the corrected
  endpoint and the flag orientation now agree (callers no longer need the
  `--direction down --rotation 90` workaround to get a visually-upward netport).
- **`schematic.check` no longer false-flags merged-stub endpoints as `wire-over-pin`,
  and floating-pin findings now carry component-level detail.** A pin coincident with
  a wire endpoint or a netflag/netport/netlabel anchor is the legitimate terminus of
  its own `sch connect` stub; when EasyEDA auto-merges collinear touching stubs into
  one long wire an inner pin lands in that wire's interior and was wrongly reported as
  a through-pin short (the official DRC stays clean). Rule 3 now excludes pins that
  coincide with a wire vertex or a net-marker anchor. Floating-pin findings now include
  `primitiveId` and a `pinDetails[]` array (`number`, `name`, `x`, `y`) so the `--json`
  report identifies the component and pin without a second lookup; the text report
  prints the per-pin name + coordinates and falls back to `primitiveId` when the
  designator is empty.

## [0.5.14] - 2026-06-28
### Fixed
- **`schematic.pin.set_no_connect` no longer reports a false success.** On EasyEDA
  Pro 3.2.x, `pin.setState_NoConnected` is a **no-op** — the pin primitive has no
  `noConnected` field (verified by re-pull, DRC re-run, and a canvas snapshot: no
  非连接标识 is ever placed and DRC still treats the pin as floating). The setter is
  typed `@public`, so the prior implementation compiled and returned `ok` while
  silently doing nothing. The handler now **verifies** the write and fails with
  `EDA_CALL_FAILED`, naming it as an EasyEDA platform limitation (not a connector
  defect) and returning `notApplied[]`. It auto-passes if a future build makes the
  setter real. There is no public `eda.*` API to place a 非连接标识 on this version —
  use `schematic.check` to enumerate floating pins.
- **`schematic.wire.create` now normalizes nested `points` (issue #5).** EDA's
  `eda.sch_PrimitiveWire.create` only accepts a **flat** `number[]`
  (`[x1,y1,x2,y2,…]`); a nested `[[x,y],…]` payload failed with
  `EDA_CALL_FAILED / "create failed!"`. The connector now flattens nested points
  at a single source of truth (`normalizeWirePoints` in `util.ts`), so CLI /
  `call` / sch.py / `debug.exec_js` all accept either form. Also validates the
  list is an even-length (`≥4`) run of finite numbers. CLI `sch wire --help` and
  `auto-layout-sop.md` updated to document both forms.

### Added
- **`schematic.check` — reconstructed per-item design check + routing-quality
  rules.** The EDA schematic DRC API (`eda.sch_Drc.check`) returns only an aggregate
  `{count,type}` and `layout-lint` only sees component bbox overlap; this fills both
  gaps by computing findings geometrically from primitives. Rules: (1) **floating
  pins** — a pin is connected iff a wire touches its coordinate (NC-marked excluded),
  grouped by component as `{designator, pins[]}` (the exact input
  `schematic.pin.set_no_connect` takes); (2) **wire-crossing** — two wire segments
  cross in their interiors (a routing tangle; shared endpoints/junctions excluded),
  reported with the intersection point; (3) **wire-over-pin** — a pin sits in a
  wire's interior (EasyEDA trims+connects there → unintended short; enforces the SOP
  "chain pin→pin, don't run a wire through a pin"). Returns `{passed,
  summary{floatingPins,wireCrossings,wireOverPins,…}, findings[]}`. CLI:
  `easyeda sch check` (`--json`, `--strict`, `--all-pages`). Verified live via a
  detect→fix→re-check loop on an ESP32-S3: 2 wire-crossings found and driven to 0.
- **`schematic.drc.check` now returns per-violation detail.** Normalizes the SDK
  result into `{passed, fatal, summary, violations[]}` — each violation projects
  `{level, rule, message, primitiveIds, designators, x, y}` (raw kept) plus a
  severity summary and a `fatal` count for the design-flow S5 gate. CLI `sch drc`
  prints one line per violation and exits non-zero only when `fatal > 0`. NOTE: the
  schematic SDK only provides an aggregate, so detail degrades honestly to
  "N issue(s) — EDA returned no per-item detail" (use `schematic.check` for the
  itemized floating-pin findings).
- **`schematic.snapshot` anti-stale metadata (issue #2).** The snapshot result now
  carries `primitiveCount` (live components + page primitives on the current page),
  `capturedAt` (ISO timestamp), and a `stale` advisory string. EasyEDA does not
  auto-redraw after `eda.*` edits, so `getCurrentRenderedAreaImage` can return a
  byte-identical STALE frame; callers compare `primitiveCount` across two snapshots
  to detect when the image didn't change but the page did. Judge state by data, use
  the screenshot for layout only.
- **`schematic.page.clear` — one-shot page reset.** Deletes every page-level
  primitive on the active page (components, net flags/ports/labels, wires, buses,
  and graphics — arcs/circles/rectangles/polygons/text), not just components.
  `preserveSheet` (default true) keeps the sheet/title block; `dryRun` reports
  per-type counts without deleting. Returns `{deleted:{...}, total, deletedIds}`.
  Fixes the trap where `schematic.component.delete` left wires/buses behind while
  `components.list` reported a clean page, forcing a fall back to raw
  `debug.exec_js`.
- **`schematic.primitives.delete` — generalized, any-type delete.** Routes each
  requested id to its owning `sch_Primitive*` class so wires/buses/graphics/flags
  can be deleted alongside components; omit `primitiveIds` to delete the current
  selection (select-all → delete). Reports `notFound` ids.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-06-27
### Changed
- **Version bump to pair with the daemon/CLI artifact-path change.** No connector
  behavior change vs 0.5.7. The CLI now sends its working directory and the daemon
  writes artifacts (snapshots, netlist/BOM exports) under `<cwd>/.easyeda/artifacts`
  with sortable timestamped names (`<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<kind>-<short>.ext`) instead
  of a flat `artifacts/art_<uuid>` in the daemon's cwd. Released together to keep
  CLI and connector on the same version.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- **Heartbeat-carried context.** The connector now re-reads the active
  project/document on each heartbeat (~3s) and pushes it to the daemon only when
  it changed. `easyeda daemon health` (and project routing) now reflect a UI
  tab-switch within one interval — previously context refreshed only on connect
  or as a side effect of running an action, so it lagged the UI until the next
  command. The initial post-connect push is unconditional; reconnects reset the
  change-detection signature so they always re-push.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-06-27
### Changed
- **Rebuild to pair with the daemon's live-context + `doc` work.** No connector
  behavior change vs 0.5.5 — this build exists so a window stuck on a stale
  connector can be re-imported to pick up real version reporting + port-scan
  (49620–49629). The daemon now refreshes each window's context from every action
  response (so `health` no longer reads `home` forever) and `easyeda doc ls/switch`
  drives the discover→switch loop on top of the existing `document.open` action.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-06-27
### Fixed
- **Handshake reports the real connector version.** `connectorVersion` was a
  hardcoded `0.1.0`, so `easyeda daemon health` could not reveal which build a
  window was actually running — useless for spotting a stale open window. esbuild
  now injects `extension.json`'s version at build time (`__CONNECTOR_VERSION__`).

## [0.5.4] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- **Board (板子/组合) management** — `board.list`, `board.current`, `board.create`,
  `board.rename`, `board.copy`, `board.delete`. A Board binds one schematic + one
  PCB; these expose `eda.dmt_Board.*` so the schematic↔PCB grouping is editable
  (and a floating PCB can be linked before `import_changes`).

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- **Schematic page management** — `schematic.page.create`, `schematic.page.rename`,
  `schematic.page.delete`, `schematic.rename` (`eda.dmt_Schematic.*`).
- **明细表 (title block)** — `schematic.titleblock.get` / `schematic.titleblock.modify`
  to read and adjust the drawing-sheet title block (the editable "图纸" surface;
  EasyEDA Pro exposes no set-paper-size API).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-27
### Added
- **Editor view shortcuts** — `view.fit` (适应全部 / `K`), `view.fit_selection`
  (适应选中), `view.zoom`, `view.region` via `eda.dmt_EditorControl.*`; act on the
  focused canvas, shared by schematic and PCB.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- **PCB layout intelligence** — `pcb.components.arrange` (cluster / grid auto-layout
  seed) and rendered bounding boxes in `pcb.components.list`.
- **PCB layout adjustment** — `pcb.align`, `pcb.distribute`, `pcb.grid_snap`,
  `pcb.components.move`.
- **Board outline (板框)** — `pcb.outline.set` / `pcb.outline.get` / `pcb.outline.clear`.
- **PCB DRC** — `pcb.drc.check`, normalized to `{passed, violations}`.

## [0.4.10] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- `homepage` pointing at the GitHub repository (open-source link for the listing),
  as a plain URL (no `#readme` fragment).

## [0.4.9] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- Marketplace manifest finalized: `repository.type` is `github` (per the official
  `eext-extension-demo`); removed the optional `bugs`/`homepage` fields — the
  marketplace flagged the `bugs` content and neither field is required. No email
  or other private data ships in the `.eext`.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- `repository` field in the manifest and this `CHANGELOG.md` (marketplace
  submission requirements).

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-26
### Changed
- Release tooling keeps a **stable UUID** by default, so a new version updates in
  place (uninstall the old entry, then import); a fresh-UUID build is now an
  explicit fallback. No change to the connector's runtime behaviour.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- **Self-healing reconnection.** The connector no longer permanently gives up
  after a few failed retries. After the initial fast attempts it falls back to a
  quiet background poll, so a daemon that is started or restarted *after* the
  editor auto-connects with no manual **Reconnect**. A connection lost to a daemon
  restart also recovers on its own.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- `.eext` packaging so the extension installs reliably. Bundled a JPEG logo.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- Netflag / netport **orientation**: corrected for EasyEDA's y-up coordinate
  system and fixed rotation handling in `connect_pin` (reverted a wrong rotation
  negation).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-25
### Added
- Initial connector: a WebSocket bridge (port-scans 49620–49629) to the
  easyeda-agent Go daemon, dispatching typed schematic actions to the official
  `eda.*` API, with auto-reconnect and a heartbeat.
- `connect_pin` composite action and the netflag/netport orientation convention.
- Header menu: **Reconnect**, **Stop**, **Toggle Auto-Connect**, **About**.
## [1.4.0]

- 1.4 schematic connectivity data flow baseline.
