# Dev Environment & Debug Playbook

How to stand up a working loop against **EasyEDA Pro** and iterate on the
connector fast. Covers both the **desktop client** and the **web editor**
(`pro.lceda.cn/editor`), plus a **hot-reload** trick that skips the
uninstall→re-import dance entirely.

Companion docs: [connector-contract.md](connector-contract.md) (the wire
protocol & runtime constraints) and [protocol.md](protocol.md) (message
envelopes). This file is the operational "how do I run it" guide.

## The AI-agent automation testing loop (what this whole setup is for)

The pieces below combine into one repeatable loop an AI agent (or you) runs to
develop + regression-test the connector against a LIVE editor, hands-free:

1. **Bootstrap the live environment** — with a browser-control tool
   (chrome-devtools MCP) the agent opens the web editor, opens a project by
   `#id=<projectUuid>`, and waits for the connector to attach — no manual clicks.
   The agent-facing SOP (exact steps, retries, pitfalls) is
   [`.agents/skills/pcbpilot/references/environment-setup.md`](../.agents/skills/pcbpilot/references/environment-setup.md);
   §1–4 below are the manual equivalent.
2. **Iterate the connector fast** — edit `extension/src`, `make eext`, then
   **hot-reload** into the running editor via IndexedDB (§5) — no uninstall /
   re-import / restart. Go/daemon changes hot-reload via `air` (`make dev`).
3. **Verify against real geometry, not tests alone** — drive the typed actions
   against the live board; judge by data (`sch/pcb list`, `drc`, `check`,
   `layout-lint`), never by a screenshot alone (stale/blank-frame traps, Core
   Rule 7 in the skill). "Builds + unit tests pass" ≠ "works live" — several bugs
   this project shipped only surfaced on a real board.
4. **Probe → file → fix → merge → re-verify** — run a real design task as the
   probe (the fixed regression case is [`esp32MiniRequire.md`](../esp32MiniRequire.md);
   the copy-a-golden-board harness is `training/copy-check.py`), file each gap as
   a GitHub issue labeled `ready-for-agent`, let ClawFlow implement + open a PR,
   then **you merge and live-verify** (the operator can't do runtime acceptance —
   see the advisory-loop section at the bottom). The rolling gap/roadmap ledger is
   [2026-07 历史探针记录](reviews/2026-07-esp32mini-findings.md).

## TL;DR loop

```
make dev                       # daemon with air hot-reload (rebuilds on .go change)
# open EasyEDA (desktop or web), open a project, import the .eext once,
# enable "Allow external interaction"
pcbpilot daemon health          # windows[] should list your connected editor
pcbpilot project info --project <name>   # first typed action round-trip
```

## Prerequisites

- Go toolchain + `make` (see repo root `Makefile`).
- `air` for daemon hot-reload: `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`.
- Node ≥ 20 for building the connector `.eext` (`make eext`); run
  `npm install` in `extension/` once (brings `ws`, used by the hot-reload server).
- EasyEDA Pro: desktop client **or** the web editor `https://pro.lceda.cn/editor`.
- For the hands-free agent loop (optional): a **chrome-devtools MCP** server (drives
  the web editor + runs the hot-reload inject) and the **`gh` CLI** (the
  probe → issue → PR → merge cycle). Without them the manual §1–5 flow still works.

## 1. Start the daemon

```bash
make dev                 # air live-reload; leave running in a terminal
# or one-shot:
./bin/pcbpilot daemon start &
./bin/pcbpilot daemon health   # status=found; windows[] empty until a connector attaches
```

The daemon listens on `127.0.0.1:61832-61841` (`0xF188`-`0xF191`) and speaks the handshake in
[connector-contract.md](connector-contract.md).

## 2. Open a project (this step is manual)

The connector activates via `onStartupFinished`, which only fires once a
project is open in the editor. **The CLI cannot open a not-yet-open project**
— that first open is always done in the editor UI:

- Desktop: File → Open, or pick a recent project.
- Web: double-click a project in the list, or navigate to
  `https://pro.lceda.cn/editor#id=<projectUuid>`.

Once open, document switching *is* scriptable:

```bash
pcbpilot doc ls --project <name>            # list pages/PCBs, ★ = active
pcbpilot doc switch <page|pcb|uuid> --project <name>
```

## 3. Import the connector + grant permission (first time per install)

1. **高级(A) → 扩展管理器(E)… → 导入** and pick
   `dist/pcbpilot-connector.eext`.
2. A security prompt appears: external-interaction permission is **disabled
   by default**. Confirm it.
3. Enable the permission: in the connector's detail page, open the
   **配置 (Config)** tab and tick **允许外部交互 (Allow external interaction)**.
   Without it, every `eda.sys_WebSocket` call throws (see connector-contract.md).

After enabling, the connector's watchdog reconnects within a few seconds —
no manual Reconnect needed.

## 4. Confirm the round-trip

```bash
pcbpilot daemon health          # windows[] now lists connectorVersion / easyedaVersion / context
pcbpilot project info --project <name>          # structured data flows back
pcbpilot notify --project <name> --message "hi" --type success   # visible toast in the editor
```

Prefer `--project <name>` over `--window <id>`: it routes by project and
survives windowId churn across reconnects.

## 5. Hot-reload the connector (skip uninstall → re-import)

Re-importing a `.eext` is slow and error-prone: EasyEDA dedups by UUID, so you
must uninstall the old one first (a version bump alone silently fails), and an
already-open window keeps running the OLD code until reloaded. There's a much
faster path once you know where EasyEDA keeps installed extensions.

### Where extensions live: IndexedDB

EasyEDA Pro stores every installed extension in the browser's **IndexedDB**,
not on disk. This is true for both the web editor and the Electron desktop
client (the desktop app is a Chromium webview).

- **Database**: `User_<teamUuid>_v6` (the `teamUuid` is the one returned by
  `pcbpilot project info`).
- **Object stores**:
  - `extensionsIndex` — one record per extension, keyed by `uuid`. Fields:
    `config` (the parsed `extension.json`), `isEnable`,
    `isAllowExternalInteractions` (yes — the permission is just this boolean),
    `fileIndex`, `fileSize`.
  - `extensionsObjectStorage` — one record per file, key = `<uuid>|<path>`,
    with `source` being a `File` object. The connector's only executable file
    is `<uuid>|dist/index.js`.
  - `extensionsUserConfig`, `standaloneScript`.

### The trick

Overwrite the `<uuid>|dist/index.js` record with a freshly-built bundle, bump
`config.version` in `extensionsIndex`, then reload the page. EasyEDA re-reads
the extension from IndexedDB on load, so the new code runs — **no uninstall,
no re-import, no file dialogs**.

### Transport constraint

The editor is HTTPS, so `fetch('http://127.0.0.1/...')` is blocked as mixed
content. But `ws://127.0.0.1` is allowed (that's exactly how the connector
reaches the daemon). So move the new bundle over a **local WebSocket**, not
HTTP.

### Steps

Two committed scripts do this end to end — no external tooling needed:
`extension/scripts/hot-reload-server.mjs` (the WS file server) and
`extension/scripts/hot-reload-inject.js` (the browser-side IndexedDB writer).

```bash
# 0. One-time: install the ws devDependency the server uses.
(cd extension && npm install)

# 1. Prepare an independent X.Y.Z-dev.N version in connector/npm/Skill metadata
#    and changelog; build and install the local package (no public release).
make local-build VERSION=vX.Y.Z-dev.N DIST="$PWD/dist/local-vX.Y.Z-dev.N"

# 2. Serve the fresh bundle over a local WebSocket (one-shot; exits after serving).
node extension/scripts/hot-reload-server.mjs &     # ws://127.0.0.1:8790

# 3. In the EDITOR PAGE, run hot-reload-inject.js — paste into the browser console,
#    or (agent-driven) pass its body to a chrome-devtools MCP evaluate_script call.
#    Call hotReloadConnector with TEAM, UUID, VERSION, EXPECTED_VERSION,
#    EXPECTED_SHA256 (fresh installed bundle hash) and BUNDLE_SHA256 (local hash).
#    It checks the existing permission/version/hash, atomically updates both
#    records, verifies the stored result, then schedules the host reload.

# 4. Verify the new code is live.
pcbpilot daemon health                       # connectorVersion shows the new version
```

If the editor has unsaved/open library documents, Chrome may show “重新加载此网站？”
after step 3. Confirm **重新加载** in the browser; until that dialog is handled the old
connector's `debug.exec_js` request can remain at the head of its FIFO and later typed
actions will correctly refuse with `CONNECTOR_QUEUE_BLOCKED`. After reload, wait for a
new `windowId`/`connectedAt` in `pcbpilot daemon health` before issuing a write.

The inject script writes the IndexedDB records described above; the server reads
`extension/dist/index.js` + the version from `extension.json`. The server takes `--port`, `--bundle` and `--keep`; the injector accepts
`PORT` and `RELOAD` options — see the file headers. Both hashes are required.
The injector rejects missing/disabled installations and never changes permission
flags. Its single readwrite transaction remains alive while hashing the old File;
puts execute inside an IndexedDB event callback so the transaction is active.
An identity/hash error or failed put aborts both writes.

`connectorVersion` in `daemon health` is compiled into `index.js`
(`CONNECTOR_VERSION`), so a changed value is proof the new bundle is running.

For a same-version development build, `make connector` is sufficient; do not
infer loaded code from the version alone. Compare the stored bundle hash with
`extension/dist/index.js`, confirm a new window ID / connectedAt after reload,
and run the changed action through the ordinary CLI. The inject script also
works via `pcbpilot --project ceshi debug exec` in the in-app browser (verified
2026-09-08): this avoids browser-control timeouts and manual reinstall. Save
open schematic and PCB documents first. Prefer this committed workflow before
asking the user to uninstall/import the connector.

### Minimal WS protocol (if you build your own transport)

Server is request/response over a JSON WebSocket:

- Client → `{"action":"getUpdatedFileTree","fileList":[]}`
  Server → `{"action":"getUpdatedFileTree_Response","fileList":[{path,id,hash,status},...]}`
  (empty `fileList` makes the server mark everything as `add`.)
- Client → `{"action":"updateFile","file":{"path":"index.js","id":..,"hash":..}}`
  Server → `{"action":"updateFile_Response","success":true,"file":{path,hash,size,mtime,content}}`
  where `content` is base64.

The IndexedDB key uses the connector's install path (`dist/index.js`), while
the server's `dir` root maps to that dir's contents — so a server file `index.js`
lands at IndexedDB key `<uuid>|dist/index.js`. Mind that offset.

## Troubleshooting

- **`daemon health` shows `windows: []`** — the connector isn't attached.
  Check: project actually open? permission "允许外部交互" enabled? For a
  freshly-imported connector in an already-open window, reload the page to
  trigger `onStartupFinished`.
- **Permission toggle is hard to find** — it's not on the extension card;
  it's in the connector's **detail page → 配置 (Config)** tab.
- **Uninstall confirm dialog is flaky to automate** — ticking the "I
  understand" checkbox re-renders the confirm button. Prefer the hot-reload
  path (section 5), which never uninstalls.
- **Uninstall silently does nothing (desktop 3.2.149, macOS, 2026-09-23)** —
  three attempts on PCB Pilot Connector 0.1.0 (card button, detail button,
  and disable-then-uninstall; checkbox ticked, Confirm clicked on the
  re-rendered button, app fully quit and relaunched in between) all closed the
  dialog without an error, yet the extension stayed in 已安装 at 0.1.0. A
  following import of 0.2.0 with the same uuid was then silently de-duplicated.
  Disable/enable still works. Official recovery for extensions that cannot be
  removed is the web editor's `safetyMode=true` URL parameter; the
  `DANGEROUS_OPERATION_DeleteExtensionStorage=true` parameter deletes **every**
  extension and script and is not an acceptable fix. Remaining options: the
  IndexedDB hot-reload (section 5, needs the connector enabled and connected),
  a fresh-uuid import (`make eext-fresh`) with the old entry left disabled, or
  a clean install in the web editor.
- **What finally worked (same machine, same day)** — the user uninstalled the
  old entry by hand; EasyEDA was then fully quit and relaunched (until then
  the uninstalled 0.1.0 kept running in memory and stayed connected); the new
  `.eext` was picked by clicking it in the file dialog; then 配置 → "Allow
  interactive with external" (and "Show at header menu") was ticked, after
  which `health` reported `connectorVersion: 0.2.1`, `connectorVersionOk: true`.
  Imports that failed silently along the way, cause not isolated: a
  `0.2.1-dev.1` build (the manifest spec requires `major.minor.patch`, so
  `-dev.N` versions can only be loaded through the IndexedDB hot-reload, never
  imported); a `0.2.1` build that still carried `images/logo.svg` and a stray
  `.DS_Store`; and the clean `0.2.1` build chosen through the ⌘⇧G path sheet
  before the relaunch. The package now excludes `.DS_Store` (`.edaignore`) and
  the logo source lives in `docs/brand/`, so the `.eext` holds only the files
  the 0.1.0 package that imported fine held. The v0.2.0 release asset still
  contains `images/logo.svg`; whether that blocks its import is unverified.
- **`fetch` to the daemon/localhost fails in the editor** — expected;
  HTTPS→HTTP mixed content is blocked. Use `ws://127.0.0.1` (the connector and
  the hot-reload transport both rely on this being allowed).
- **Automating the web editor via chrome-devtools**: it uses a dedicated
  Chrome profile. If it errors with "browser already running", a stale Chrome
  is holding that profile — kill the process using that `--user-data-dir` and
  let the tooling relaunch. The extension install persists in the profile, so
  you don't need to re-import after the relaunch.
- **Network blocks a git host** (e.g. a corporate gateway blocking a mirror) —
  clone from a machine with open egress (a cloud VM) and copy the tree back.
- **Connector port-scans forever (`WebSocket ... closed before ... established`
  on every port 61832–61841), `daemon health` shows a daemon but `windows: 0`** —
  usually TWO daemons fighting over the port: `air` restarted the daemon after a
  `.go` edit but a previous instance lingered, so `/health` answers on the port
  while the other instance's `/eda` WebSocket never completes the handshake.
  Diagnose + fix:
  ```bash
  pgrep -fl "pcbpilot daemon"          # >1 line = orphans fighting
  lsof -iTCP:61832 -sTCP:LISTEN -n    # which PID owns the port
  pkill -f "pcbpilot daemon"; sleep 2  # kill all, then start ONE clean:
  nohup ./bin/pcbpilot daemon start > /tmp/pcbpilot-daemon.log 2>&1 &
  ```
  Then reload the editor page so the connector re-handshakes. (If you run the
  daemon under `make dev`/air, prefer letting air own it — but after a messy
  restart, a single clean `daemon start` is the reliable reset.)

## Notes

- The connector persists in the browser/profile's IndexedDB, so it survives
  restarts of the editor. Wiping site data removes it.
- The hot-reload approach touches EasyEDA-internal IndexedDB structures that
  are **not an official, stable API** — treat it as a dev-only convenience and
  re-verify the store names/keys if EasyEDA bumps its schema version
  (`_v6` today).

## Native net-label compatibility (verified 2026-09-05)

EasyEDA's official `eda.sch_PrimitiveAttribute.createNetLabel(x, y, net)` API
is documented as a **BETA** API and is marked **"ADD since EDA v4"**. The
arguments are simply the schematic X/Y coordinate and a non-empty net name;
there is no alternate direction/rotation argument. The connector's
`net_label` implementation passes that signature correctly.

Do not infer support from the editor UI alone: manual placement of a net label
may work while the typed connector call hangs. In EasyEDA 3.2.186, a live
`sch connect --kind net_label` probe timed out while awaiting the native promise
and rolled back the stub wire, even with connector 1.3.1. The same page could
still be made electrically correct by placing EN as a net label in the UI;
the connector readback exposed the EN net name but did not enumerate the native
label as `componentType: "netlabel"`.

When diagnosing this class of issue, follow this order:

1. Run `pcbpilot health` and record the exact EasyEDA and connector versions.
2. Read the official API page and check its "ADD since"/BETA note before
   changing arguments.
3. Run a one-pin live probe, then immediately `sch read`/`sch check`; never
   assume a timeout means nothing landed.
4. If the native promise does not settle, restore the previous connection,
   save, and report a runtime-version compatibility gap. Upgrade EasyEDA to a
   runtime that supports EDA v4 before retrying automation.

## Advisory loop: what the implement operator can and cannot do

ClawFlow's implement operator runs `claude -p` in a **headless worktree** — it
has the repo source but **no live EasyEDA editor, no connected connector, no
running daemon with an attached window**. That draws a hard line:

| Task type | Operator? | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Code / doc change** | ✅ yes | new `pcb check` rule, `sch rebind-*`, netlist cross-check |
| **Runtime acceptance** | ❌ no | end-to-end board bring-up, any `pcb drc passed:true` gate |

**Why runtime acceptance can't go through the operator**: its pass criteria
(`pcb drc passed`, `pcb check` 0 ERROR, BOM saved) are **runtime products** that
only exist by driving a live editor through the S0–S6 / P0–P10 flow. No source
edit produces them, and the headless worktree shows `windows: []` — every flow
command returns `NO_CONNECTOR`. A correct operator run on such an issue **fails
and says so** (it must not fabricate a "DRC passed" PR — that violates the
"never feed a pre-cooked answer" rule).

**The advisory loop, done right:**
- Code/doc issues → label `ready-for-agent` → operator evaluates, implements,
  opens a PR, auto-merges → **you re-verify** with the editor loop (build + tests
  for code correctness, then run the new command against a live board).
- Runtime-acceptance issues (e.g. the ESP32 end-to-end regressions) → **do NOT**
  label `ready-for-agent`. Mark them as interactive/manual and run them from a
  session that has chrome-devtools MCP + a live daemon + a connected editor.

Verified 2026-07-06: issues #44 (rebind actions) and #45 (netlist cross-check)
went code → operator → PR → auto-merge → re-verified in an editor session; issue
#42 (ESP32 end-to-end) was correctly `agent-failed` by the operator with a
precise "no attached editor" explanation.
