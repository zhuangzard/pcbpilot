"""Single source of truth for netflag/netport body orientation.

The whole 12-entry rotation table is determined by four facts (see
orientation.json): the +90° body cycle ``up → right → down → left`` and the
body direction at rotation 0 for each family (power=down, ground=up, port=right).
(2026-06-29: cycle/anchors re-calibrated from rendered flag bodies; this visual
rotation mapping is independent of the schematic endpoint coordinate signs.)
``derive`` reconstructs the table; ``load_body_rotation`` reads the canonical
spec next to this file. The lint check and the connector's connect_pin both
derive from these same facts, so they can never drift — tests/run.py asserts it.
